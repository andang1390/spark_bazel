Available for download now, the first versions of Firefox 11 Aurora for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android came out just after the stable build of the browser updated to version 9. The Android update is again the more notable release, as the new native Android interface reaches a wider audience. For the first time, the browser also supports playing Adobe Flash content, which competitors like Dolphin HD and Opera have offered for a while.

This is more than a new look, though, as many of the browser's features have been stripped out. This includes Firefox Sync, which allows seamless synchronization of personal data like bookmarks, passwords, and browsing history, and Mozilla's popular add-ons. In a blog post announcing Firefox 11 Aurora for Android, Mozilla promises that Sync and add-ons will return ""soon.""

Personally, I've found Sync to be the single most useful feature in the mobile browser. To be able to open a tab on the desktop, and have it nearly instantaneously pushed to my Android, makes jumping from desktop to phone or tablet practically seamless. On the other hand, very rough testing indicates that Firefox 11 is a much faster browser. While site-loading tests indicate speed gains only around half a second to a full second, initial app start time tests show major speed gains over the current Firefox 9 of around 50 percent.

Meanwhile, Firefox 11 Aurora for desktops gets two useful changes. Windows 7 and Vista users will no longer see the User Account Control (UAC) for Firefox after the browser's initial installation. This completes Firefox's alignment with Chrome's seamless updates, which haven't required your interaction with the UAC. On first installation, the browser now adds Chrome to its list of browsers from which it can import your personal data.

Other changes in Firefox 11 Aurora are aimed at developers. More HTML5 code is supported, Google's SPDY protocol for faster site loading can now be tested, Tilt support allows for 3D Web page visualization, and the HTML5 video controls have been redesigned. Check out the Firefox 11 Aurora changelog published by Mozilla.

The new Aurora builds bump Firefox 10 to beta status. Changes in this version offer users an improved add-on experience, as all compatible add-ons except for binary add-ons will not be disabled by the browser. This sorts out the ""maxversion"" situation, which required developers to set a Firefox version number with which the add-on would stop being compatible. Mozilla expects that this will significantly decrease the number of problems related to add-ons. The Sync setup process has been improved, too.

For developers, Firefox 10 beta improves the developer experience in the browser with a bucket of changes. These include support of the full-screen API for better gaming in Firefox, Page Inspector and Style Inspector for testing new code, WebGL improvements for better 3D rendering, and Orion code editor support in the Scratchpad tool for on-the-fly coding. Mozilla released the Firefox 10 beta changelog here, with a scheduled graduation to stable release the last week in January.",html

Basic usage bugs have gone the way of last season's molting, so this fun app that's part music player, part Web browser, and all about music discovery, management, and playback is ready for every day use.

During installation, it'll ask if you want to load your iTunes music directory or another media directory, or perform the task later. Processing 5,000 songs took about 3 minutes, which is not a bad pace. It then asks you which of the preinstalled Songbird extensions you want to load. Most of these, like the iPod, Mass Storage Class, and USB device managers only make the app stronger.

The left sidebar provides quick links to bookmarks, downloads, your music library in an iTunes-style interface, and several music discovery Web sites to get you started. When you're looking at any Web site with MP3s available for download, Songbird will open a new window at the bottom of the main browsing pane. Double-click on a song to play it, and links on the right let you purchase the track from Amazon, iTunes, eMusic, and Amie St. They also tell you the format of the track--MP3 or AAC, for example--and provide a blog link for more info.

Songbird has a growing library of extensions, and support is slowly growing for those written originally for Firefox. Although it works on Windows 7, it doesn't yet have any Windows 7-specific features. Still, Songbird is more than stable enough to take flight for the music-loving, Web-surfing fanatic in all of us.",html

Originally announced earlier this month at CES 2011, Kaspersky Pure Total Security takes the highly regarded set of features offered in Kaspersky Internet Security and mixes in some extras that are designed to appeal to people who have more complicated, multi-machine setups at home.

Most notable among these new features is centralized home network security management. It allows users to control the security settings of the other computers within their home LAN that are also running Pure, and it will work remotely as long as the user is connected via VPN. Pure will let you run scans, configure security policies, run backups, and monitor parental controls for multiple machines from one computer.

Pure also is the only Kaspersky home offering for North American residents that includes local backup management. The company took its preexisting Crypto-Storage product and integrated it with Pure, so that you can run and manage backups similarly to how Pure will let you handle security settings.

Another new feature in Pure is the inclusion of password management from Lamantine's StickyPassword, which along with basic password-management controls has a portable option so you can export your encrypted passwords onto a USB stick and use that on any PC. Pure also comes with file encryption and shredding.

Kaspersky has further plans for new products. In mid-March, the company hopes to release Kaspersky Small Office Security, which will include server support for up to 10 computers, and free tech support, and is qualified on MS servers Windows servers 2008 R2 and above. And like many competitors, the company plans in the next few months to add Android and BlackBerry support to its mobile security option that currently is only available for Symbian and Windows Phones.

A one-year license for Kaspersky Pure Internet Security covers three computers, and retails for $89.95.",html

",Amazon Silk: Weaving a new browser,,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Amazon

Among Amazon's announcements today is that the retail and cloud services giant is stepping into the browser market with a new Web browser that ships in its upcoming Android-based tablet.

That new browser is called Silk, and it's the latest effort to make Web browsing faster, especially on portable devices where the hardware is typically slower than what a user might have on a desktop or notebook computer. It can also learn how you browse the Web, and extend battery life by putting some of the heavy lifting in the cloud, Amazon says.

The company is putting the weight of its massive cloud services infrastructure behind the browser to make up for potential hardware shortcomings. While the Kindle Fire tablet ships with a dual-core processor that's capable of running games and other applications, the company says that users have come to expect a certain amount of speed on the desktop that isn't always there on mobile devices.

Amazon's solution is what it calls a ""split browser,"" a method that makes use of local processing for some things, while tapping into its Elastic Compute Cloud to process and serve up content faster than users might get it directly from the device.

That approach is similar to that of Olso, Norway-based Opera, which in 2005 debuted its Opera Mini browser. Like Amazon, that too offered heavy lifting for some pages on the company's servers, while promising to cut down on mobile data spending by shrinking large pages.

Amazon says its process for determining what the local hardware does versus its own servers is entirely automatic, and done behind the scenes, so users don't have to manage any special settings or even know what the software is doing. The technology also takes into account things like how good your connectivity is, and how pages are coded to figure out how to put the device's processor to work versus its own, something the company says can result in better battery life.

Amazon

Adding to that, Amazon says the software is actually able to learn user habits using the same technology it employs on its retail site, then grabbing pages it thinks people might visit before they're clicked.

""As Silk serves up millions of page views every day, it learns more about the individual sites it renders and where users go next,"" Amazon's Silk page reads. ""By observing the aggregate traffic patterns on various web sites, it refines its heuristics, allowing for accurate predictions of the next page request.""

That's an interesting parallel to efforts by Google. In June of this year, the search giant took the wraps off of Instant Pages, a feature that served up prerendered versions of Web pages from its search results. The feature went live in Google's Chrome browser just last month, and like Amazon's effort, brings the promise of faster browsing, based in part, on user habits.

One big thing to note is that the software will only be available on the Fire, the company's $199 tablet that arrives in November. It's unclear whether it will seep into other platforms after that. Amazon has a habit of extending its software to other platforms, yet Silk represents one of the big differentiators from competitors, and something the company can position as a reason to buy its device over another.

Below is Amazon's pitch for Silk, shown at today's event:",html

Among the myriad modern ways to transfer files from one computer to another, you can now add BitTorrent Sync to the list. The company unveiled a very rough, pre-alpha version of the service today as part of its new initiative for developing new tech called BitTorrent Labs.

In a blog post announcing BitTorrent Sync, the company revealed few details. It's designed to ""manage personal files across multiple computers,"" the company wrote. They also requested user feedback to help them ""build something sick. If you're comfortable using early, incomplete software, and if you're committed to helping us figure out a better way to sync, we want to hear from you,"" the post reads.

Currently, you must fill out an application and wait for a response before you can use the service. It asks numerous questions, including how many computers you intend to use the service on, which operating systems you want to use Sync on, and which country you live in.

According to the blog TorrentFreak, once you're in the service is easy to set up even though it's in pre-alpha. The blog also notes that syncing is not entirely a new thing for BitTorrent. Companies such as Facebook and Twitter use torrents to distribute files and for software deployments.

Sync joins other BitTorrent experiments such as BitTorrent Live for live-streaming, and the recently announced BitTorrent Surf for turning Google Chrome into a torrent client.

Apple unveiled the upcoming revisions in June at its annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference and said it would release public betas of both OSes this month.

Apple's goal with public betas is to give users a chance to preview what's coming and to submit feedback prior to the final releases expected this fall. Apple ran a similar public beta program last year for OS X Yosemite. The company also runs a separate, private beta program for its developers.

As you may expect, beta software -- even from Apple -- can be unstable, features may not work as you expect, and you may come across bugs and software incompatibilities. So take care when installing and running.

(Credit: Apple)

Back up before you download the beta

Make sure you have a good and current backup. For iOS, archive an iOS backup with iTunes.

If you are looking at El Capitan, consider running the beta on an external hard drive or a separate partition, not on your primary Mac drive. If checking out iOS 9, look at installing the beta on a second device, not your primary one.

Unless you just can't wait to see what Apple is up to, you might find it makes more sense to wait till the fall, when the final versions are expected to ship. Read our first look at El Capitan to see what's new.

Installing and uninstalling

According to Apple, you'll be able to install the final version of El Capitan over the public beta. However, if you want to remove the beta before then, you'll need to first erase the beta software, reinstall the latest shipping version of OS X, and then restore your apps and files from the backup you thoughtfully made.

Likewise, with iOS 9, you'll be able to install the final version of iOS when it ships. If you decide to back out of the beta program ahead of the fall release, put your mobile device in recovery mode and restore it. Then you can set up your device from your archived backup.

How to get the betas

To take part, head over to Apple's beta software program page and sign up with your AppleID. After you've signed up, use your AppleID to sign in to the page.

For OS X, you should see a Download the OS X El Capitan Public Beta button and a redemption code for downloading the El Capitan beta installer from the Mac App Store. The download is big, but once it finishes, follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation.

For iOS 9 download and installation, follow the instructions on the Guide for Public Betas iOS page.

Apple says you will receive updates to the El Capitan public beta through the Mac App Store and the iOS 9 public beta through iOS Software Update.",html

As Scott Forstall, Apple's head of iPhone software development, promised, the update is a major one with a host of sorely needed features for application developers and consumers. Check out our slideshow of the iPhone OS 3.0 screenshots.

James Martin/CNET

In all, Apple promises 100 new features with iPhone 3.0, including multimedia messaging and a landscape keyboard. Although Apple did not reveal all 100 additions on Tuesday--which leads me to wonder just what they'll count as a new feature (perhaps cut, copy, and paste will count as three)--the highlights were worth the trip to Cupertino, Calif.

Yes, a few hoped-for features are still missing, but iPhone 3.0 is more about what we got than what we didn't. Apple will release the update this summer. It will be free for iPhone 3G and iPhone Classic users, but iPod Touch users will pay $9.95.

What we got

Multimedia messaging

At long last, we have it. We figured that it was coming so it was at the top of our iPhone 3.0 Wish List. Yet I feel a little weird getting so excited about such a basic feature that almost every other cell phone has.

Also, it's very disappointing that iPhone Classic owners will not get MMS, even if they upgrade. Apparently, the original iPhone lacks the necessary radio to make MMS work. That, of course, leads me to the very pertinent question: why?

Landscape keyboard

Another feature that's long overdue. In addition to the Safari browser, it now can be used in any application, including e-mail. Hallelujah.

James Martin/CNET

Cut, copy, and paste

This was the first new application mentioned. It works across all applications, and you'll be able to use it with text (even in Web pages) and photos from the camera album. The interface looks intuitive and user-friendly, with the movable grab points and the shake to undo. But I wonder if you'll be able to copy images on Web pages and if you'll have access to the clipboard.

Judging from the audience reaction, this is one of the features that most excites users and developers. During the Q&A session at the end of the presentation, Forstall defended the long wait for the functionality by saying it's not obvious how to do (cut and paste) while taking into account security issues and making it work nicely with the touch interface. Although there must be some measure of truth to that explanation, I'd say it was more of a matter of Apple figuring out how to do it in the way the company wanted.

Stereo Bluetooth

I wasn't expecting this one, but you'll have the opportunity to listen to music through wireless headphones. Of course, that leads me to wonder if an Apple wireless Bluetooth headset will be far behind. The bad news is that iPhone Classic users won't be able to add this feature, either.

Text messaging

In addition to text forwarding, which was on our wish list, you can delete individual messages in a chat thread. That's something I hadn't thought of before, but I welcome it. A resend button when texting would be nice as well, but I can live without it, for now.

Real-time turn-by-turn directions

The iPhone will become a full-fledged GPS device with iPhone 3.0, though in a roundabout sort of way. The feature won't be native, but it will come through apps.

Because of licensing issues, however, developers will need to supply their own maps rather than using the Google Maps on the phone. While that's not the best scenario, particularly because it suggests that you'll have to pay for such apps, it makes some sense, considering that the iPhone SDK prohibited apps with turn-by-turn directions in the past.

Forwarding meeting invites and contacts

Now the iPhone can really be a business device. There were needed additions indeed.

James Martin/CNET

Full search

A new Spotlight feature will allow you to search your calendar, mail, iPod library, notes, and contacts all at once. To access the feature, you need only to swipe your finger to the left from the main home screen. That's a huge improvement over the current situation, in which multiple paid apps search only single areas at once.

Stocks

You'll be able to get headlines for the tickers saved in your Stocks application. That's one feature I've thought about often, so I'm glad to see it. You'll also be able to see a chart in landscape mode, and you'll be able to get the stock price at any point on a chart.

Voice memo

This is another thing we should have seen a long time ago. Yes, there are existing apps that offer this functionality, but you shouldn't have to pay for an app to get it.

Peer-to-peer networking

Forstall used gaming as a likely use for this feature. It's definitely welcome, but it would be nice to send data files through Bluetooth without needing an app.

In-app purchases

Buying apps and game levels without going through the iTunes Store will be easier, but like the gum in a supermarket check-out line, I suspect that it will lead to a lot of impulse buying.

Push notification

This is also a good add, though I'd prefer it to be a native feature rather than driven by individual apps. I'd like to see one umbrella push system for all linked e-mail accounts. The functionality seems to be a bit scattered, as it's currently described.

Other additions

Forstall ran quickly through the remaining additions, which were displayed on a slide. They include syncing notes with your Mac, a shake-to-shuffle feature like on the iPod Nano and some Sony Ericsson phones , antiphishing technology and autofill for Safari, parental controls, and Wi-Fi auto log-in. They all sound promising, including the unexpected ability to access YouTube accounts right on the phone.

What did we miss?

As I mentioned earlier, the list of added features is much longer than the list of missing features. But for convenience's sake, here is a list of the features that I'd still like to see.

Tethering

Rumors persisted that we would see the ability to use the iPhone as a modem. Forstall said the Apple is ready to switch the feature on but that iPhone carriers around the world need to figure out how to support it.

Voice dialing

Yes, there are apps, but it should be a native feature.

Background processing

This is out because Forstall said it eats up to 80 percent of the iPhone's standby battery life. While I question whether it is really that bad, I'd rather not push it on a device that can barely last a day of heavy use.

Video recording

My guess is that Apple can't make it work to its satisfaction on the current camera. As for more camera features, it's still a mystery why we don't have them. But knowing Apple, I'm sure that the company is more interested in keeping things simple and user-friendly. If improving the camera is on the iPhone development list, I'd be that it's at the bottom. Still, plenty of VGA camera phones offer editing features.

Flash support

Forstall and his colleagues dogged this topic by saying they had no announcements ""today."" Perhaps that's a sign that it's coming down the road.",html
http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13970_7-57385530-78/social-goes-big-on-opera-mini/,Social goes big on Opera Mini,,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"BARCELONA, Spain--The maker of the second-most popular mobile browser in the world has given its feature-phone fans something to tweet about, as Opera Mini Next debuted and brought several smartphone features to ""dumb"" phones.

The big new feature that's kicking off the inaugural build of Opera Mini Next, the developer's preview of the browser, is ""smart"" page called Home. Home will live next to Opera's Speed Dial, its customizable collection of regularly visited Web sites that occupies top billing across all Opera browsers, and it serves a similar function. It will let you bookmark regularly visited, regularly updated sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Gmail, so that you can quickly check for updates without having to load the site in full.

In an interview last week, Phillip Gronvold, Opera's product manager for mobile, said that because of the Turbo feature's data compression the automatic updates only cost 1 KB of data per update. The feature is on by default but can be turned off in the browser's settings.

He also clarified that Turbo works slightly differently on different versions of Opera. On Opera Mini, which has more than 160 million users worldwide, can compress Web traffic up to 90 percent. That compression, Gronvold said, can come at a high cost sometimes: occasionally, a site will break. Opera Mobile and Opera for PCs use a slightly different compression methodology that doesn't compress the data quite as much, he explained, but it also doesn't bork sites.

Opera

Those huge bandwidth savings are must for many people on rate-limited plans. Gronvold also said that despite the in-development designation, he expected most people who installed Opera Mini Next to find it to be stable. ""It's not fully ready because we haven't finished yet setting up local content in all the different markets,"" he said. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to test out Opera Mini Next before this story was written.

Also in Opera Mini Next is the ability to set more than nine sites to Speed Dial. However, the Android and iOS versions of Opera Mini won't include the Home screen. Instead, smartphone versions of Opera Mini Next will see smoother browsing powered by hardware acceleration.

Opera Mini Next installs concurrently to the stable version of Opera Mini and can be distinguished by a white icon as opposed to the standard red one.

Joining Opera Mini Next 7 on stage is the latest full update to the Mini's smartphone counterpart. Opera Mobile 12 for Android , leap-frogging the version number of Opera for PCs, which are still on version 11, includes several notable changes. Opera Mobile 12 brings WebGL support for 3D rendering on your smartphone, native HTML5 support, the same unlimited number of Speed Dial sites as Opera Mini Next has, and in-browser support for your device's camera. Gronvold suggested an Opera-built demo Web site at shinydemos.com for testing WebGL on the mobile browser.

As for the future of Opera on mobile devices, Gronvold expressed high hopes but he said that it's going in a different direction from competitors such as Mozilla. ""A Boot-to-Gecko system is something that we're not interested in. We dabbled in it with Opera Platform in 2004, but we don't see it as a solution for our product portfolio with our partners,"" he said.

Instead, Opera will continue to develop Mini and Mobile concurrently. Mini will focus on feature phones, lower-powered smartphones, or those devices on rate-limited networks, while Mobile will be a more precise replica of the PC version of Opera.

When it comes to program installation, I'm a strong believer in caveat emptor. If a software publisher warns you during the installation process that it will install the Yahoo search bar or a Firefox extension along with its program, and makes it clear that you can opt out of it, then so be it. Nobody's forcing a gun to your head, and it's important to read each of the installation screens no matter which program you're installing--at the very least to make sure that the program is not legitimately changing a directory or installing somewhere you don't want it to be.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

However, what's made clear in this Lifehacker post, and I've verified, is that popular multi-protocol instant messaging client Digsby will grab your processor cycles when you're not looking and use them without giving you a say in the matter. Whether Digsby is using your CPU for cancer research, the hunt for Yoda, or to help marketing agencies crunch their numbers is irrelevant. By not giving you the opportunity to choose to do so, they are distributing malware. Before you think that's too harsh of a comparison, a botnet like the notorious Conficker does the same thing: it grabs your processor, and gives you no choice about it. Digsby is merely polite about it, giving notice in the EULA and waiting until your system is idle. Of course, nobody is forcing you to install the program, but they're not exactly making this information prominently available.

To be fair to Digsby, they called out this behavior in a blog post back in December 2008. However, it's not noted in the installation process itself, whereas the other opt-out choices have been made easy to see and decide upon. This is abusing a user's trust, because--like the mention in the EULA--the information is essentially buried and inaccessible unless you know to look for it. As the comments to the Digsby blog post indicate, it's been receiving negative feedback about this since it announced it. To take no steps to rectify the situation except to give users more choices on promoting Digsby is unethical.

In light of all this, and the Digsby team's reluctance to address what we consider a serious flaw in the program, the Download.com editorial team has decided to lower the ratings score for Digsby.

I've requested comment from Digsby about their policies, and will update this post when I have a response.

Users looking for alternative multi-protocol IM clients should look at Pidgin, Miranda, Trillian, or VoxOx.

UPDATE: Digsby representatives have commented on the situation, both in a new blog post and directly to me. I found this new blog post to be somewhat disingenuous. It starts off by saying, ""Several months ago, we started testing two unique revenue models to help us keep Digsby free and ad-free for all our users,"" and then the next sentence points to the above-cited blog post from December 2008. That's eight months ago, not exactly the standard definition ascribed to ""several."" It's a minor point, but one I found emblematic of Digsby's reaction to the situation because, as you'll see, nothing's changed.

The post continues, explaining that its relatively new installer is no different from other software publishers that offer a free product but force users to opt-out of installing a toolbar or search results hack. As noted above, I agree with that premise. Although it's unfortunate that you have to opt-out to avoid these changes to your system, they are definitely presented clearly.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

After that, there's an explanation of the ""research module,"" named Plura, which is the bit that borrows your CPU cycles. ""Some of the research Digsby conducts may be for nonprofit projects like the ones mentioned above (in the blog post) and some may be for paid projects, which will help us keep Digsby completely free,"" the blog states, which means that whatever the project is that you're being asked to donate your spare processor time to, you're not going to learn what it is and it's none of your business. At least with SETI, you know what it is you're donating your cycles to. With Digsby, it's a crap-shoot--and hardly a transparent process.

When asked for comment last night, Steve Shapiro of Digsby said, ""It's clear from this that a lot of users still weren't aware of it since they don't read the terms of service or track the blog closely,"" and I think that's a point we can all agree on. He also said: ""(W)e will be making a change in the product to make sure that every user we have now and every user who signs up from this point forward is clearly informed of what we do to keep Digsby free and shown how to enable/disable the functionality.""

Further e-mails with Digsby's Director of Public Relations Erick Davidson revealed what those changes were: ""When it runs for the first time, there will be a pop-up that will stay until the user reads more about it."" Despite having left my computer idle for 30 minutes after doing a clean install of Digsby build 62, when the Plura system theoretically would be running, I saw no pop-up warning when I returned to it.

Rushed out overnight, build 62 of Digsby does not include any changes to the installation process. When asked, Davidson stated that this was because the installer is provided by another company, and added in a follow-up e-mail that there is no time line at the moment for introducing a toggle to Plura into the installer.

Users who want to keep Digsby but don't want the Plura system to run can disable it by going to the menu bar Help option, clicking on Support Digsby, and choosing Disable for Help Digsby Conduct Research.

As I've said, the issue for me isn't that Digsby is running Plura, it's that it's doing it without giving users the ability to opt-out before installation. Given that Digsby's competitors are able to offer similar and, in some cases, identical features, and that they're able to do it without burying a bad-faith feature in the EULA or behind a semi-functional pop-up, I'm going to stand by my assessment from yesterday: For now, don't use Digsby.",html

Nicholas Nethercote, a developer at Mozilla, wrote on his blog that Firefox 15 beta is likely to be ""drastically"" faster than Firefox 14, in some cases.

The changes in the beta focus on memory leaks, which Nethercote describes as occurring when a program allocates some of your computer's memory to use, but then fails to release it when finished with its task. He wrote back in January 2012 that memory leaks in add-ons, from the most popular Firefox add-ons to the simplest ones to those developed by corporations, all contribute to instability in the browser. While many of those add-ons have been fixed since then, he points out that the browser must be able to handle add-ons that still leak.

""We have confirmed, via in-house testing and from real-world telemetry data, that [Firefox 15 changes from the MemShrink research] prevents the vast majority of leaks that occur in existing add-ons,"" he wrote.

The blog post announcing the new beta said that Firefox 15 beta also introduces people to built-in PDF support, a feature that Google Chrome has had for a while; support for version 3 of Google's SPDY networking protocol; and native support for the Opus audio codec, an open source format which offers better compression than MP3, Ogg, or AAC.

Developers get some changes in Firefox 15, too, including a JavaScript debugger, an event timer, WebGL improvements, and JavaScript just-in-time (JIT) engine improvements for faster browsing.

People running Firefox for Android 15 beta (download) on tablets will see a dramatic shift, as the new tablet interface for the browser debuts on the beta channel. It's been available in Firefox for Android Aurora for a few weeks, and features a design similar to the new Firefox for Android.

The installer for Firefox for Android will detect if you're using a phone or tablet, and install the proper interface without any additional input required.

The Android beta also gets the ability to switch to a site's desktop view from the Menu; swipe to close tabs; and search in-page. You can now pause, resume, cancel, or retry a download from the Download Manager; toggle which data to clear from Settings; and import your bookmarks and history from the default Android browser.

Firefox for Android beta continues to support many of the under-the-hood features of the desktop version, including the new Opus and SPDY v3.

SAN FRANCISCO--Certain apps floating around CTIA Fall 2010 are compelling enough to make it to the ""download immediately"" list. HeyWire is one such app, and of course, the fact that it's free certainly adds to the appeal.

The main purpose of HeyWire is to simplify real-time text communication across multiple messaging platforms and devices. It does this by gathering various modes of texting within a streamlined, easy-to-use interface, and then assigning personalized phone numbers to each user. Simply pull up the app on your device, and you can send a quick message to your phone book contacts, in addition to any friends available on a variety of instant-messaging clients, such as Facebook, AIM, and Yahoo Messenger. As an added bonus, you can also post updates to Twitter from within the app.

HeyWire

However, one of HeyWire's coolest features is that it lets people send--and receive--international texts for free. Since the app operates separately using either Wi-Fi or your data plan, the messages won't hit your cell phone bill individually (you may want to make sure you have a robust data plan, though). In the case of texts that are sent to another HeyWire user, the recipient won't be charged either. (Otherwise, he or she may be charged an incoming message fee by the service provider.)

The HeyWire app is currently available in iTunes for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad, with additional apps planned for Android and BlackBerry devices going forward. In addition, the service will offer a Web element, which itself has a really neat, streamlined interface. It's currently in invite-only beta, but you can register for a chance to check it out early.",html

Google is trying to bridge between the Web and Android worlds with a new unified user interface called Material Design -- one of many features coming to the upcoming ""L"" version of Google's mobile operating system that the company showed at its Google I/O show Wednesday.

The new design has elements that dynamically shrink and expand, adds more white space between elements, offers lots of animation, and provides a more 3D look emphasized by shadows and lighting effects. It's designed to put the emphasis on the most important content of a screen, Google said.

Google controls Android, but with so many browsers, the Web is more complicated. To help bring Material Design there, too, the company is promoting a library of prewritten software called Polymer that lets designers build custom interfaces with technology called Web components. Polymer works with recent versions of major browsers.

""We wanted one consistent vision for mobile, desktop, and beyond, something clear and simple that people would intuitively understand,"" said Matias Duarte, Google's vice president of design.""You can bring the same fluid Material Design to every screen.""

screenshot by Stephen Shankland/CNET

That unity is important for Google since that should make it easier for users to access Google services through different devices, including its browser, its Chrome OS operating system, and the ever wider variety of Android devices.

Google itself will use both technologies in updates to its own apps and services starting this summer, Duarte said.

Polymer will work on Chrome for mobile, too, blurring the boundaries between Web apps and native Android apps and making it possible to use Material Design on either foundation.

Material Design opens up a 3D interface even on 2D screens by letting programmers specify not just what color a pixel should be, but how high it should be in a virtual stack. ""As part of the L preview, we'll allow application developers to specify an elevation value,"" Duarte said. ""The framework will render the correct perspective with virtual light sources and real-time shadows.""

It's just a visual effect today, but it could be handy in future years with 3D displays and the possibility of tactile touch screens that actually raise portions of a display.

Google's Android versions are named alphabetically after treats: Cupcake, Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jellybean, and the current KitKat. Google hasn't revealed the name of the next version of Android, but it'll begin with L, and ""lollipop"" is one idea bandied about.

Google showed a host of other changes coming with the L version of Android besides the new interface. Among them:

Easier unlocking when the phone can determine that it's in the hands of its owner. It can detect things like position and nearby Bluetooth-enabled watch, letting people simply swipe to unlock the phone rather than enter a passcode or use an unlock pattern.

A lock screen that behaves just like today's notification screen, where people can see alerts and swipe them out of the way.

A new battery-saver mode for when people are going on hikes or otherwise will be away from a charger.

New developer tools that will let programmers reduce power consumption better. ""You can expect significant battery performance in L,"" said Dave Burke, director of engineering for Android.

A do-not-disturb mode so the phone won't interrupt when its owner doesn't want to be pestered.

Sundar Pichai, who leads Google's Android and Chrome work and who is pushing the two domains closer together, boasted of fast Google's development pace -- and took a swipe at Apple. A few weeks after Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook dinged Android, Pichai pointed to Android features such as custom keyboards and widgets that will arrive in the upcoming iOS 8.

""Those things came to Android 4 or 5 years ago,"" Pichai said.

http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/windows-10-privacy-settings,Windows 10 privacy settings,"August,Pm,Tom Mcnamara",2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"When you start Windows 10 for the first time, there's a point in the setup process where you choose your level of privacy. The installer encourages you to use the express settings instead of customizing. But the express path will give Microsoft and Windows 10 more info about you than you may be comfortable sharing -- such as how you browse the web, what websites you visit, which apps you use and how frequently you use them -- so let's walk through how you can change that.

When you're done here, you should also look at our guide to Windows 10 security settings.

Privacy settings in the Control Panel

You access privacy settings through the Control Panel, which is now called Settings in Windows 10. The quickest way to get there is a keyboard shortcut: Windows-I. Another method is to tap the Windows key, which opens the Start menu, and then click the Settings button. You can also right-click this button and select Pin to Taskbar to create a shortcut for easier access later.

We'll focus on the second-to-last section in Settings, which is conveniently labeled Privacy. Since the Settings tool brings you back to wherever you last left off, you may not see the Privacy button if you've been fiddling around in Settings. If that's the case, click the back arrow in the upper left-hand corner of the window to go to the home window.

Before we start flipping switches, a word of warning: although you may be tempted to disable everything that reduces your privacy, doing so may impair or disable certain apps and interactions between apps. If you find that happening, you'll have to come back and re-enable things until the problem goes away, which could be time-consuming if you've changed a lot of settings. Unfortunately, the Privacy section does not have a button to restore default settings, so you'll have to track your changes on your own. We recommend taking screenshots of each section before you change anything.

Lastly, most categories in the Privacy section have a ""learn more"" link to a Microsoft webpage with more detail about what certain functions do. However, the level of disclosure and illumination varies.

The General pane

Clicking the Privacy button opens a window with two panes. On the left is a category list, and on the right are the settings for the category that you're looking at. In the General pane, there are four settings: advertising ID, SmartScreen, handwriting recognition, and language.

Advertising ID identifies your Web behavior to deliver targeted ads. It works like this: if you open the Windows 10 Travel app and also the Calendar app, Microsoft can use that info to show you ads for Expedia or Southwest Airlines, for example. That's assuming the app uses ads to begin with. You won't start seeing banner ads when you open the calculator, but Microsoft Edge (which replaces Internet Explorer as your default Web browser in Windows 10) may run these tailored ads when you go to Bing or Outlook.com.

Advertising ID communicates no personal information about you. It's a sort of beacon to deliver targeted ads showing something that you might want to buy. In theory, if the ads are more relevant to you, you're more likely to click them, which helps both the advertiser and the people selling the ad space, and maybe you, too, if you get a better shopping experience. But if you prefer to disable advertising ID, you can do so in the General pane. Note that disabling it does not block ads, only Microsoft's ability to target ads.

The SmartScreen filter is a layer that Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer use to help protect you from dangerous or suspicious websites. The filter does this in two ways. One, it analyzes the website for questionable behaviors, like opening fake pop-up windows or redirecting you to other websites. Two, SmartScreen checks the Web address against a list Microsoft maintains of websites that are known to be fraudulent. You get the occasional false positive, meaning that a safe website is accidentally caught in the filter. But for the most part, SmartScreen is a helpful tool, so we recommend leaving it on.

The third setting helps improve handwriting recognition by sending Microsoft data about how you write. It doesn't send what you actually write. This setting will be grayed out if Windows 10 does not detect a stylus. Since it's not sending personally identifiable info, we don't see the harm in leaving it on.

The language setting helps websites detect which language you're using so they can deliver regional info, like maybe a Dow Jones stock ticker for users of US English or rugby scores for users of UK English. The setting also helps websites understand where its users are coming from, which can help them figure out what kind of content or user experience to create.

The Location pane

If you are using an administrator account, as you will be by default, then you will see the option to disable location info for all user accounts on that device. Below that is a toggle for the specific account that is currently logged in, which will be grayed out if location services are disabled for everyone. Location can be used to let Windows 10 apps display region-specific info like weather and sports scores, or to show you map locations and shopping choices in your area. If you disable this setting, you can still enter your location info manually -- it just won't be sent automatically.

Some apps will use your device's Bluetooth or Wi-Fi functions to determine your location even when your location setting is disabled. You can toggle that feature on and off in the Radios pane (in the list to the left). Bluetooth and Wi-Fi will still function, just without location info.

Camera and microphone

As you've probably guessed, these two sections have a toggle that disables your device's webcam and mic. You can also toggle for specific apps, including pre-installed apps designed by Microsoft and apps you have installed to replace them. If you purchased this device from a system builder like Dell, Acer, Toshiba, or Lenovo, they may have some pre-installed apps as well.

A Windows 10 app gets camera and microphone permissions by default if it wants it, regardless of how likely it is to use it, so we recommend checking these settings periodically if you're leaving your webcam enabled. Generally, you should only give webcam and mic access when you know you'll use them in that app, such as in Skype or HipChat. Note that disabling your webcam and mic in Settings may not prevent malware from secretly re-enabling it, and it won't have an effect on other operating systems that you may be dual-booting. You might want to put a piece of black tape over your webcam lens when you're not using it.

Speech, inking, and typing

The speech section is where you toggle Cortana's speech recognition, among other things. Cortana is like Apple's Siri, but it works on the desktop as well as on mobile devices. You can use speech recognition to dictate a text message to send to someone in your contacts list. Enabling the speech setting also improves handwriting recognition and search suggestions that are made as you type.

Contacts, Calendar, Messaging, and Radios

These next four sections work roughly the same: there's a toggle to turn the function off altogether, and a list of apps that you can toggle on an individual basis. If no apps are listed, none are asking for those permissions. If you're not using Cortana, and if you're using Gmail and Google Hangouts instead of a Windows 10 mail app or chat app, you can probably turn all of this off without much negative impact.

Other Devices

Windows 10 tells you a little about how the functions in the Other Devices section operate. But the company doesn't say much about what those functions will actually be used for; instead, it tells you to go to each app's website and look at the app's specific settings to figure that out. That's not encouraging, so most people will probably disable Other Devices until we get a better idea of how this stuff works. That doesn't seem like a bad idea.

Feedback & Diagnostics

Feedback & Diagnostics helps Microsoft improve how Windows 10 works. The feedback function controls a small notification bubble that sometimes pops up in the lower right-hand corner of the screen, asking you to rate a particular program or function in Windows 10. Unfortunately, Microsoft has tied diagnostic and usage data together, but you can still limit sharing to basic error info by going with the Basic option. The Enhanced setting sends Microsoft info about often and how long you use certain apps but also gives the company more diagnostic info for troubleshooting and for developing system updates.

The Full setting may send Microsoft personally identifiable information, such as the contents of a document you were working on when you experienced a crash. Microsoft states that it will not use this info ""to identify, contact, or target advertising to you,"" but the potential privacy breach is pretty serious, so we recommend not using the Full setting, even though it sends a large amount of diagnostic info that helps Microsoft improve its apps and system updates. In fact, if this device is provided by your employer, the Full setting may be forbidden by company policy. If not, it arguably should be.

Background apps

We've reached the last category of the Privacy section. Unlike the other categories, this one does not have a global toggle; each app must be toggled individually. Our list ran to 24 items, none of which seemed like they had to operate in the background to work effectively, so we disabled them all. Everyone's situation will be different. If you're a gamer, you may want to toggle the Xbox app on. If you use the Windows 10 calendar to keep track of events, then you'll probably want to let that run in the background as well.

Still have questions about Windows 10? We've answered a bunch (Part 1, Part 2), and you can read our full review. If you're not ready to commit to Windows 10, you might want to test it in a virtual machine instead (though the Insider preview is not currently available -- you'll need to test with Windows 10 Enterprise instead).",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-13880_3-20040375-68.html,Three productivity-enhancing Firefox add-ons,,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"About a year ago Google Chrome became the first browser I open each day to check the daily news, e-mail, and social networks. It's just faster, plain and simple. But Firefox remains the browser I use for work because of the many productivity-boosting add-ons that have been released for the program.

Recently I've been using three Firefox extensions to help me get more work done in less time: one removes all the extraneous material from Web pages to show only the main content, another monitors the amount of time I spend on work-related and non-work-related sites, and the third pops up a reminder at the interval of my choice to stay limber by stretching.

Readability brings the Web's content to the fore

Plenty of Firefox add-ons block the ads that accompany the content on Web pages, but even with the ads excised it isn't always easy to find the content you're looking for. Readability from Arc90 and Baris Derin reloads the current page to remove its non-essential content.

Three large buttons in the top-left corner of the Readability window allow you to revert to the page's original format, print the reformatted page, and send the page via e-mail. The add-on lets you adjust the page's margins and font size, and you can choose one of five page styles. You can also convert the page's links to footnotes. To view these options, right-click the Readability icon on the right side of the Firefox status bar at the bottom of the screen.

screenshot by Dennis O'Reilly/CNET

Some Readability users report problems when using the program along with the NoScript script-blocking add-on, but the extension worked without a problem when I tested it--on a PC without NoScript. You can activate Readability by pressing Ctrl+Alt+R on Windows or Command+Option+R on a Mac. Reload the original page by pressing Ctrl+R or Command+R, respectively.

Show your boss how hard you've been working with RescueTime

You may never have wondered what percentage of your browsing time is spent doing actual work, but your boss might have an opinion about it. Even if you're just curious about your workaholic status, RescueTime provides a unique view of your Web habits.

To view your RescueTime statistics, click the extension's icon in the Firefox status bar or choose Tools > View RescueTime on the browser's main menu. The program shows the length of time you've spent using Firefox today, in the last week, and in the last month. You'll also see the percentage of time you've spent ""distracting browsing"" and how that percentage compares with other RescueTime users.

screenshot by Dennis O'Reilly/CNET

Either I'm wasting a lot more time than I think I am, or RescueTime's manner of determining what is and is not a ""productivity"" site is out of whack. The program indicates that I spend two-thirds of my browsing time distracted, which means 79 percent of RescueTime users work harder than I do. Some of my former bosses might not be surprised by this finding, but I honestly believe I'm working harder than this.

You can get a more-detailed view of your browsing habits by clicking View Detailed Stats, which opens the RescueTime dashboard. There you view your Firefox usage by day, week, month, or year, as well as by category and activity. Other graphs rate your efficiency and your time spent on sites as very productive, productive, neutral, distracting, or very distracting.

You can also view the productivity ratings for all the sites you've visited and adjust the ratings to reassign sites RescueTime identifies as ""distracting"" to be ""productive,"" or vice-versa. To go off the clock, simply press one of the three pause buttons: 15 minutes, 1 hour, and all day. The RescueTime Pro version promises ""real-time alerts,"" more-detailed reports, and offline tracking of meetings and other activities.

The site claims not to tie your browsing history with you personally, and since the program doesn't require registration, I tend to believe this. However, any site that monitors your Web habits must be used with some discretion.

Get up, stand up, and use your muscles when StretchClock indicates

Spending hours on end with your eyes glued to the monitor and hands locked on the keyboard is a good way to end up in an orthopedist's waiting room. You can have the best of intentions to take regular breaks during the workday but still find your muscles cramping up after consecutive hours of relative immobility.

screenshot by Dennis O'Reilly/CNET

The StretchClock extension from Shane Gildnes pops up a break reminder at the interval you choose and even suggests some low-impact exercises suitable for the office. In addition to being able to adjust the time between stretch reminders, you can pause the countdown, reset it, or choose to exercise now.

The program's default alert is to open the StretchClock site with a Flash video ready to guide you through a stretch. This can be an abrupt interruption to your workday. Click the settings button on the StretchClock toolbar in the Firefox status bar to change the duration between breaks and to have the program play a reminder or wait for a click rather than open a new browser window.

While I didn't try out any of the StretchClock stretches--I've had my own stretching routine for many years--I'm a staunch proponent of regular, extended work breaks. Even if the program serves only to remind you to get out of your chair for a few minutes, it has served a valuable purpose and justifies the space it takes up on your ever-more-crowded Firefox status bar.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20023269-264.html,Microsoft's new IE9 triggers speed-test squabble,,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Microsoft has released a seventh test version of Internet Explorer 9 the company says is better at ""real-world"" Web-based JavaScript programs. But with it has come a rival's accusation that Microsoft essentially engaged in the storied computer industry practice of benchmark engineering--designing technology to be fast on an artificial speed test.

The seventh IE9 platform preview comes with new improvements to its Chakra JavaScript engine. And Microsoft asserted Chakra is engineered to do better on actual Web site tasks rather than narrow benchmarks.

""Over the last few weeks, we've been tuning the JavaScript engine for more of the patterns we've found in real-world sites. Based on the progress since the last platform preview, we're releasing an updated platform preview build,"" said Dean Hachamovitch, Microsoft's IE general manager, in a blog post yesterday.

The company has been creating a range of Web applications to let people test all the browsers that figure in today's fierce competition. And with the new version, Microsoft signaled its growing impatience with one test of JavaScript, the SunSpider benchmark--both with how basic its tests are and how limited it is compared to the full range of browser performance challenges.

""Microbenchmarks and real-world Web patterns have little in common,"" Hachamovitch said. ""We think people should evaluate browser performance with real-world scenarios. Real-world scenarios involve using all the subsystems in the browser together rather than looking at single subsystems in isolation...real-world Web sites use JavaScript to respond to user input, manipulate strings, and move objects around the screen, and much more.""

Microsoft has griped about oversimplified browser benchmarks before, but that didn't stopped it from prominently publishing results that now show it faster than Google's Chrome, Opera Software's Opera, Mozilla's Firefox, and Apple's Safari.

But also this week, Mozilla took issue with one aspect of IE and JavaScript: ""dead code elimination.""

This idea involves scrutinizing software before it runs and eliminating parts that are mere busywork--flawed code programmers don't always realize they use. One aspect of SunSpider, a test called math-cordic, ""is written exactly in a way that triggers this general optimization,"" Hachamovitch said.

One objection came from Mozilla JavaScript engineer Rob Sayre, who filed an IE9 bug that led to Hachamovitch's explanation. Sayre, though, wasn't satisfied by that explanation, he indicated in a blog post.

His analysis showed that IE9 is using dead-code elimination for some tasks involving a number of mathematical operators. ""Curiously, the IE9 team has chosen not to eliminate more expensive operations such as multiplication or division. The set of analyzed operators do happen to be the ones that appear in the math-cordic benchmark,"" Sayre said.

Then came his damning conclusion, essentially that Microsoft had tuned Chakra just for a good SunSpider result.

""I don't think it's possible to consider IE9's implementation of dead code elimination to be a serious general-purpose optimization. It seems clear that it hasn't been tested on anything other than SunSpider,"" Sayre said.

Added Mike Shaver, Mozilla's vice president of engineering, in a tweet, ""Disappointed in it's based on real-world' DCE [dead code elimination] nonsense from MSFT; wish they'd just admitted starting with SS [SunSpider] benchmark and making mistakes."" And he offered a challenge: ""Treasure hunt: find a pattern in any site on the internet that is eliminated by the #IE9 DCE, other than math-cordic!""

Benchmark engineering is an ages-old practice in the computer industry. For example, with prominent server database test, TPC-C, server makers would attach absurdly large numbers of hard drives in an effort to achieve high scores. The design represent real-world constraints customers faced.

Alternatives to SunSpider exist--for example, Google's V8 benchmark and Mozilla's new Kraken. But even those are narrow tests that don't exercise many aspects of browser performance such as page-loading speed, graphics, and user interface responsiveness.

The situation frustrates Chris Wilson, who for years worked on IE but recently joined Google to become Web platform advocate and developer at Google.

Wilson ""would rather see collaboration across vendors and developers on suite of tests that span DOM [the document object model interface browsers use to interact with Web pages] as well as pure JS [JavaScript],"" he said in a tweet. He added that he prefer people ""back away"" from a single numeric JavaScript benchmark score as a performance claim, ""frankly, because it has little to do with real-world user performance.""",html
http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/apple-macbook-core-2/4652-3121_7-32148808.html?tag=dl-blog,Apple MacBook 2006 Model review:,,2006-11-14T23:45:00-08:00,"Now that the high-end MacBook Pro has Intel's Core 2 Duo CPU, it's high time the latest processor technology filtered down to Apple's more consumer-friendly MacBook line. There are three MacBook models, one with a 1.83GHz CPU and two with 2.0GHz CPUs. The MacBook starts at a mere $1,099, but our review unit is the most tricked-out of the three, offering the faster CPU and a larger hard drive for a still palatable $1,499. These 13.3-inch notebooks, available in the standard Apple colors of black and white, are nearly as powerful as their 15- and 17-inch Pro cousins, and they include a lot of the same features, such as the built-in iSight camera and Front Row remote. If the handful of compromises vs. the Pro model, such as the screen size and the lack of discrete graphics, isn't a deal breaker, the MacBook is a no-brainer for anyone who wants to step up to an Apple laptop or upgrade their older MacBook.

While the entry-level MacBook is available only in white, when you move up to the 2.0GHz version, black is also an option. Our black MacBook isn't quite as sharp as the metallic MacBook Pro we looked at recently, but it still has a very distinctive look, with rounded edges and a boxy iPod-like design. The matte black surface is nice to run your hands over and is largely fingerprint resistant. The white 2.0GHz model is $200 cheaper and starts with a smaller hard drive, but it can be upgraded to an identical configuration.

Measuring about 1 inch thick, 12.8 inches wide, and 9 inches deep, the MacBook is small enough to carry around every day and just big enough to comfortably function as your everyday computer. It weighs in at 5.1 pounds (5.7 pounds with the AC adapter), and while the difference is only about half a pound, it feels considerably lighter than the 15-inch MacBook Pro.

Opening the lid, you'll find a minimalist setup, including a power button, a full-size keyboard, a sizable touch pad with a single mouse button, and a built-in iSight camera that sits above the display. If you miss the scroll bar present on many Windows laptops, you'll find that the two-finger scroll option works well (run two fingers down the touch pad, and it scrolls like a mouse wheel). The keyboard has totally flat keys (a touch we also liked on the Sony VAIO C150P/B link>), instead of the slightly concave keys you may be used to. It's matter of personal preference, but we like the cleaner look of flat keys.

The MacBook supplies you with two USB 2.0 ports, a FireWire 400 port (the MacBook Pro adds a FireWire 800 port), a mini-DVI port (an adapter is required for hooking up a regular monitor), and a slot-loading SuperDrive DVD burner. You won't find a media card reader, however, which has become a common feature on many laptops. Unlike the MacBook Pro, there's no ExpressCard slot for adding components later. An Ethernet port, an Airport Extreme 802.11a/b/g wireless card, and the built-in Bluetooth take care of the networking.

At a resolution of 1,280x800, the 13.3-inch wide-screen display is easy to read and offers enough screen real estate for anything short of high-res Photoshop sessions. With a 15-inch MacBook Pro, you'd jump up to 1,440x900, but the difference is minimal to the naked eye. Movie-watching is best as a one-person experience on the 13.3-inch screen vs. the more sharable 15- and 17-inch MacBook Pro models.

Our review unit came with 1GB of RAM and a 120GB hard drive. You can double the RAM to 2GB for $175, which seems like a smart investment for future-proofing your machine, and you can ramp up the hard drive to 160GB or 200GB models for $100 and $200, respectively. Other than that, the MacBook configurations are mostly fixed, although Apple is happy to sell you a variety of external accessories, such as a USB modem jack ($49) or a mini-DVI-to-VGA adapter ($19).

Apple claims significant performance boosts, up to 25 percent from the move to Core 2 Duo CPUs. In CNET Labs' Photoshop CS2 and iTunes encoding tests, we found that the new MacBook, with a 2.0GHz Core 2 Duo CPU and 1GB of RAM, performed admirably, coming in behind the 2.33GHz Core 2 Duo MacBook Pro link> model, but not by huge margins. That's even more impressive when you consider the MacBook Pro we tested had a whopping 3GB of RAM. As expected, both Core 2 Duo systems easily outclassed an older Core Duo MacBook Pro link> from earlier this year. We have updated our benchmarks recently, so we can't compare these scores directly against the last round of Core Duo MacBooks, but the new Core 2 Duo MacBook did show a 26 percent boost over the older Core Duo MacBook Pro, well in line with Apple's claims.

In many areas, the new MacBook Pro and MacBook systems are very similar, with design, price, and screen size as the major points of differentiation. One important difference to note is in the graphics subsystem. The MacBook Pro has an ATI Mobility Radeon X1600, while the MacBooks are stuck with Intel GMA 950 graphics. So if gaming is important to you, either Windows gaming through Boot Camp or Mac native gaming, you'll want to step up to the Pro model.

In our battery tests, we got an impressive 3 hours, 30 minutes out of the MacBook--beating the 15-inch MacBook Pro by half an hour. That's about what you'd expect from a thin-and-light notebook and more than enough for a movie or two or any flight shorter than a coast-to-coast run. If you are bicoastal, Apple has offers a $59 airline power adapter, called the MagSafe Airline Adapter, as an option. It has two different plugs for working with the power ports on different airlines.

The MacBook's AC adapter--both Airline and normal models--connects magnetically to the laptop, so if you accidentally trip over the cord, it will simply detach instead of sending your new purchase crashing to the floor. You additionally get Apple's tiny Front Row remote--the same as the one that comes with the iMac; it controls Apple's Front Row software for playing back movies, music, and photos from a home-theater-style 10-foot interface.

Many people prefer Apple systems specifically for the bundled suite of proprietary software, iLife '06, which includes intuitive tools for building Web sites, creating DVDs, composing music, and working with photos.",html

Mozilla, maker of the Firefox Web browser, saw its 2009 revenue increase 34 percent from $78 million the year before to $104 million.

The organization's source of money continues to be from search partnerships, it said in its 2009 annual report, released today. The top billing goes to Google, no doubt, though Mozilla didn't break out a specific percentage and instead lumped the search giant's revenue in with Yahoo, Yandex, Amazon, and eBay.

Mozilla's contract with Google, renewed in 2008 and running through 2011, returns a portion of Google search-ad revenue to the browser maker. Mozilla drives search traffic to Google through its built-in search box. And though Google now has its own Chrome browser to promote, Mozilla indicated it's happy with the financial idea in general.

""We believe that search providers will remain a solid generator of revenue for Mozilla for the foreseeable future,"" Mozilla said in a FAQ.

Expenses--employees and computer equipment, mostly--also increased, from $49 million in 2009 to $61 million in 2009. Mozilla, though isn't a business (read about its tanglings with the Internal Revenue Service in the auditor's report PDF), but rather an organization with a mission: ""Mozilla exists to build individual empowerment, control, and opportunity into the fabric of the Internet,"" Chairman Mitchell Baker said. She added this assessment:

Mozilla is the underdog in our efforts to build participation and empowerment into the Internet. It's a big challenge to build our values into layers of the Internet where the commercial giants of our age are battling it out. Mozilla has always faced this kind of challenge. We started in an era when everyone ""knew"" our goals were impossible because Microsoft was invincible. Today, Mozilla is stronger than ever. Our opportunity to bring openness and choice to new aspects of the online experience is unprecedented.

More specifically, Mozilla said there are now more than 400 million Firefox users, 140 million of them daily, and that it's expanding with initiatives such as mobile Firefox.",html

I bought a Kindle 2 last week, after a year of waiting for the second iteration of Amazon's e-book reader. I was hesitant at first, as I still love reading hardcover and paperback books, but the free cellular Web access and the addition of magazine subscriptions from publications like The New Yorker had me convinced.

I've had it for a week now, and I love it. It feels great in my hands, and the e-ink screen creates the illusion of reading a real book. I can hold it in my hand and read from it for hours.

I also have an Apple iPhone. I've tried e-book applications like eReader and Stanza, but I just didn't find the reading experience very satisfying.

It's OK for short chunks of reading, while waiting in line or sitting on the bus, but not on a lazy Sunday afternoon around the house. Holding a small device like that for long periods of time just isn't comfortable, plus the small LCD screen can be hard on the eyes after a while. And, of course, there are books only available for the Amazon Kindle that are not at any other e-book store. It's this last criteria that really forced my hand when purchasing the Kindle 2.

So when I first heard that Amazon released the Kindle application for the iPhone (download), I immediately second-guessed my purchase of the Kindle 2. Did I make a foolish buy? Why wasn't I patient enough to wait for the iPhone application? A free iPhone app is definitely a lot cheaper than the $359 for the Kindle 2. So I downloaded the Kindle for iPhone application to find out whether I should send my Kindle 2 packing with a return slip.

When you first launch the application, it'll prompt you for your Amazon log-in information. Enter that in, and you're presented with the Home screen. If you already have a Kindle, like me, you'll see an Archived items folder with all of your Kindle purchases already there for you to download.

Using Amazon's Whisper Sync, it will also communicate with Amazon's servers to let you keep track of where you are in a book, so you can pick up where you left off in either the Kindle or the iPhone.

Bear in mind that it won't sync up samples--only books you've actually purchased. This makes me feel a little better about having a Kindle, since now I'll be able to leave my Kindle at home and continue my reading on the iPhone, and vice versa.

Like on the Kindle e-book, you can bookmark pages, increase the font size, and access the table of contents. You can buy a book or download a sample directly to your iPhone, be it via 3G or Wi-Fi. Turning the page is as easy as swiping the iPhone's touch screen.

Screenshot by Nicole Lee

There are several important caveats, however. The iPhone Kindle application supports only books, not periodicals, so I wasn't able to download my weekly New Yorker magazine or my daily New York Times subscription, though I guess you can just surf on over to those sites via Safari (or check out The New York Times' iPhone app).

Also, there is currently no way to buy and browse Amazon books within the application. Instead, you'll have to go through a Web browser, such as Safari for the iPhone. Then head to the Amazon Kindle Store, buy a book, and it'll show up on your iPhone.

Having to switch between two different applications like this is very annoying and is a serious downside to the Kindle iPhone app. If you have both a Kindle and an iPhone, but want to download a free sample to your iPhone only, make sure to select your iPhone's name in the drop-down menu under the ""Send sample now"" button.

Also, the Kindle iPhone application does not resolve my earlier complaint about reading e-books on the iPhone. Reading on the iPhone's screen for a long duration is just not very enjoyable. This is especially apparent if you encounter long paragraphs with no breaks in the text--the entire screen of the iPhone becomes just one block of words and can be difficult to read. If you want it for reading in short bursts however, this is acceptable. But for longer reading while relaxing on the couch, the Kindle wins.

There is one potential advantage the iPhone has over the Kindle, and that is color. Why would you want color in an e-book? Why, for comics, of course. I'm a big comic book fan, so I went looking for comics in the Amazon Kindle Store to see how it would look on the new Kindle 2 with its 16 shades of gray.

There aren't a lot of choices out there, so I just downloaded a few samples to check them out. The results are not that great, I'm sad to say. Each comic page is considered an image, so it's a little slower to download.

I was fine with the gray shading, but the comic format does not quite fit the size of the Kindle 2's screen. Smaller format books like manga digests look a little better, however. Still, navigating the pages is a pain. There's no way to zoom in and out of panels, and if I wanted to enlarge the images to full size, I had to do so for each page. Plus, word balloons are almost impossible to read, since I can't zoom in.

I downloaded those same comic samples to the Kindle application on the iPhone. I still couldn't zoom in, and it's still hard to read the word balloons, but I was awed and amazed that they arrived in full-blown color. Yes, I couldn't read any of them, but it gave me a small glimmer of hope that maybe someday, there'll be a way. Until then, I guess I'll have to live with the individually sold iVerse comic applications.

So if you're trying to choose between the Kindle hardware and the iPhone version, which should you pick? It depends. If you don't read that much, or if you plan on using the e-book reader as merely a supplement to your reading, the iPhone Kindle application is probably enough for you. But if you want something that will not only supplement, but replace, a lot of your reading material, the Kindle is a much better bet.",html

The Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Tor Project have released a public beta of a new Firefox extension that lets people encrypt their communications with Facebook, Twitter, and other sites.

The HTTPS Everywhere Firefox extension was inspired by Google's encrypted Web search option, the EFF said in announcing the tool on Thursday.

In addition to Facebook and Twitter, the Web sites that the software works on are Google Search, Wikipedia, The New York Times, The Washington Post, PayPal, EFF, Tor, and Ixquick.

The tool works by creating an HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) connection to the sites. But even if ""https"" is used, unless the address bar is colored and an unbroken lock icon is displayed in the bottom right corner, the page is not completely encrypted, EFF says.

Our colleagues over at ZDNet's Zero Day blog point out that using HTTPS doesn't hide a computer's IP address and users are still susceptible to tracking from broken SSL sessions displaying unencrypted third-party content.

""Forcing a full session on a popular social-networking service such as Facebook for instance, without taking into consideration the fact that SSL would not magically make all the personally identifiable information, including your IP, disappear, is wrong,"" writes Dancho Danchev on the Zero Day blog. ""Full-session SSL, in combination with tools such as Vanish, next to Tor-like/VPN based anonymity network, are great for a fresh start.""",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20001429-264.html,Google to build Flash into Chrome browser,,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Apple might be taking a principled stand against Adobe Systems' Flash Player plug-in, but Google opted for pragmatism by choosing to build the plug-in into its Chrome browser.

Google announced its Flash embrace Tuesday on its Chromium blog, but the company has been agitating for months on a related project to improve the security of browser plug-ins. Google wants the Web to be the foundation for applications, but it doesn't want the security and crash problems plug-ins can bring.

Specifically, Google said it will distribute Flash with Chrome, update it automatically, and eventually put Flash in Chrome's sandbox where its risks can be contained better.

The move isn't entirely a surprise. First, it had been reported Monday by ZDNet's Larry Dignan. But even last July, Google revealed that Adobe is one of Google's partners for Chrome OS, the browser-based operating system the company plans to release later this year. That virtually guaranteed Flash a place in Chrome OS.

What the move does indicate is that the separation between Flash and new features coming to HTML and related Web standards isn't quite as black and white as some would suppose. It's true that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript pose a competitive threat to Flash, but it's also true that there is a huge quantity of Flash content available on the Web. And note also that Adobe is adopting next-generation Web standards, too.

""Improving the traditional browser plug-in model will make it possible for plug-ins to be just as fast, stable, and secure as the browser's HTML and JavaScript engines. Over time this will enable HTML, Flash, and other plug-ins to be used together more seamlessly in rendering and scripting,"" said Linus Upson, a Google vice president of engineering, said on the blog posting.

Paul Betlem, Adobe's senior director for Flash Player engineering, was reading from the same script. ""Our hope is that the robust integration between Chrome and Flash Player will serve as a showcase for more consistent, seamless, and efficient Web browsing experiences,"" he said in an Adobe blog post.

Another interesting wrinkle here is work to overhaul NPAPI, which stands for Netscape Plug-in Application Programming Interface but which is used by several browsers. Last July, Google proposed a project called the platform-independent NPAPI. On Tuesday, Google announced it's won the support of Adobe and Firefox developer Mozilla in developing the technology.

The reason it's interesting is that one reason Google wants the changes is to let its Native Client technology use Flash or other plug-ins. Native Client is a programming foundation to give a hardware acceleration boost to Web applications, and Google is building it into Chrome and Chrome OS. A smooth handoff to Flash could be important for the cases in which Web developers want to use Native Client power but Flash's interface.

The overall direction here, then, is clear: three allies are working to make Web-based applications a more powerful alternative to those that run on computer operating systems today.",html

To preview the update, you need an iPhone 4S or later, an iPad 2 or later, an iPad Air, or an iPad Mini, and then you can download the iOS 9 beta (be sure to create an iTunes backup, in case something goes awry or you want to revert to iOS 8.4). Read on for our tour of iOS 9's highlights.

New and improved apps

News

The all-new News app brings together your favorite newspapers, magazines, websites, and blogs. Tap Explore to see a list of suggested channels (such as BuzzFeed, The New York Times, and Vanity Fair) and topics (such as Movies, Tech, and Home and Garden) and select your favorites. Or you can search for specific brands or categories. The more you use News, the more personalized the app's recommendations become. Articles are optimized for iPhones and iPads, so you can enjoy beautiful magazine layouts the way they were intended to be viewed.

Notes

Notes was once a bare-bones note-taking app. In iOS 9, Notes enables you to add maps, Web links, photos, and more; scribble your thoughts with your finger in various brush styles (from pencil to marker) and colors; and quickly find photos, maps, and more in the new Attachments Browser. With the power of iCloud, your notes will be updated across all your devices.

Maps

Besides driving and walking directions, Maps now includes a Transit tab that provides detailed public transportation directions from your starting point to your destination. The Nearby feature offers popular points of interests around you.

Wallet

You may have already used Apple Pay to make purchases with major credit cards. You can now add Discover to that list, as well as your department store cards and rewards cards. When your phone is locked, double-click the Home button to access your Wallet and use Apple Pay.

Move

If you're coming to iOS from Android, the Move app transfers your existing data -- contacts, photos, calendars, and more -- from your old operating system to your new one. It will also help rebuild your app library with suggestions.

App Switcher redux

You'll still double-press the Home button to conjure the App Switcher and swipe up to quit recent apps. But there are some changes to this feature in iOS 9 that you should be aware of. Recent contacts have moved to the Spotlight search screen, apps now appear as a deck of pages (with the home screen moving from the left to the right side), and apps cycle as you swipe through them.

Keyboard

Shortcut Bar

When you're typing an email or a document, you'll notice new shortcuts on your keyboard. On the top right, you'll find a BIU button that you can select and toggle across for bolding, italicizing, and underlining text. On the top right, you'll find buttons for copying and pasting.

Shape Shifter

When you typed a text or email in the past, it was difficult to tell what case you were in, since the keyboard remained in upper case whether shift was selected or not. But now when you tap the shift key, all the keyboard characters shift to upper or lower case, making it easier to see which case you're in.

Search becomes smarter

Siri

Siri has become even smarter, as well as more predictive and responsive. Tell Siri that you need directions to a particular location, a restaurant reservation, or a particular song to play, and Siri will do it. The search assistant can also set reminders for later.

Siri also offers smart suggestions for an app you may want to use, a contact you may want to add to an email, an event you may want to add to your calendar, and an optimal time to leave for an event based on current traffic conditions. Siri will even identify an unknown number if that number appears in an email.

Spotlight

Siri also powers the Spotlight search bar, so you can get the information or the contacts you need right from the search page. The search page now comes pre-populated with suggested apps (based on time of day) and contacts (who you are scheduled to meet), nearby businesses, and relevant news.

Power, performance, and security

More efficient processes and Low Power mode have slashed battery drainage. Smaller, more convenient updates require less space and can be completed at your preferred time -- as in, when you don't need to use your phone. Thanks to Metal, apps perform a lot faster. Six-digit passcodes and two-factor authentication make your phone more secure.

iPad improvements

One of our favorite new features is the iPad keyboard doubling as a trackpad. Touching and swiping the keyboard with two fingers takes you up, down, and across a document, note, or email in no time, which enables you to edit words or sentences more quickly than by the old touch-and-hold method.

If you have a third-generation iPad or an iPad Air or Mini, you'll be able to take advantage of three new multitasking features: Slide Over, Split View, and Picture in Picture. To activate Slide Over, pull over from the right side of the screen to the left to open up a second window that lists all your apps. Click one and open. Then pull the panel over to bring you into Split View. So now you can do two things without leaving your original screen. If you're watching a video and want to work in another app simultaneously, then activate Picture in Picture video by clicking the Home button, which shrinks your video window down and enables you to move it around. You can then work on other apps while the video runs more discreetly in the corner of your screen.",html

Firefox 8 Aurora can be downloaded for Windows, Mac and Linux, and it marks the first release of Aurora for Android.

(Credit: Mozilla)

Two add-on changes were revealed last week that represent, for the first time in possibly years, that Mozilla has forced changes on how third-party programs and Firefox interact. Basically, Mozilla is disabling the ability of a third-party program, like security suites, to forcibly install add-ons without user permission. The change comes in two parts: one automatically disables those add-ons, and when you start Firefox after the add-on has been installed for the first time, a notification window prompts users to either activate the add-on or ignore it.

The second feature kicks in the first time Firefox runs after upgrading to version 8. It goes through your add-ons and sorts them into two categories: ones you've installed, and add-ons from third-party programs. All active add-ons that you have installed will be kept active, while all third-party add-ons will be deactivated unless you choose to reactivate them. As an additional level of protection against unwanted deactivation, the feature will offer a confirmation list of the add-ons you want killed.

The company continues to develop its Firefox channels into separate beasts. Aurora 8 debuts a light-blue button color to help distinguish from the Nightly build, which has a deep blue button, and the stable build's orange button. More important than that aesthetic tweak are changes to provide better icons when dragging and reordering tabs, and a new choice in the Options menu to load tabs only on demand. This will let people who have many tabs open start the browser faster.

In Windows, the option is available in the General tab of the Options menu. On Macs, go to the Aurora menu, then Preferences, then General, and check ""Don't load tabs until selected.""

Under the hood, Mozilla continues to work on its flagship product. How the browser creates threads for HTML5 media elements has been changed, which will allow for a large number of media calls without killing the browser, and a new media APIs sees support to improve the overall performance of video and audio in the browser. Newer HTML5 standards will work in Aurora 8, including the crossorigin and insertAdjacentHTML attributes, as well as native right-click menus via HTML5. There's been a WebSocket update to the latest APIs, and a security tweak forces WebGL textures to use CORS.

Two notable changes have also landed in the new Firefox 8 Aurora for Android. The first creates the option of a master password, for one-password entry when browsing. This is available under the Privacy and Security section of the Preferences tab. You also can add Firefox bookmarks directly to your home screen in the new build.

While Mozilla continues to push ahead with its rapid release cycle, and face opposition from a vocal minority of fans that Google didn't encounter when it moved Chrome to rapid release, it is also beginning to look at changing how version numbers are counted. One blog post proposes ditching the current whole-number format and counting major versions released in a single year. For example, the fifth major release in a particular calendar year would be ""Firefox 2011.5"".",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10245934-2.html,Mozilla's Jetpack to bring next generation add-ons,,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Mozilla Labs has launched a new project called Jetpack that could drastically change how users interact with Web sites and manage third party add-ons.

In a nutshell, it enables developers to create code packages that can be toggled on and off without the end user having to restart their browser. This is something that cannot be done with Firefox's current add-ons system, but has been possible in third-party tools such as Greasemonkey, which allow users to pick and choose which scripts are active.

It solves another annoyance by letting developers create code that isn't outdated or broken every time the browser gets a major update. This is a problem that has plagued Firefox add-ons for years, and forces developers to make small tweaks or changes to get their extensions up and running--even if they've long since stopped working on a particular extension. Under this system, whatever Jetpack add-ons you have installed will still work. At least that's the promise.

In the introductory video of Jetpack (embedded below), Aza Raskin, who is head of user experience for Mozilla Labs, shows what the tool is capable of. In the first part, it's a simple ad-blocking tool that users can toggle on and off to keep the browser from loading certain page elements from ad providers. In the second half, he demonstrates how custom code can do the same thing to other page elements, depending on what developers have coded into any one particular Jetpack module.

Mozilla Labs Jetpack - Intro & Tutorial from Aza Raskin on Vimeo.

Besides no restarts and no breaking with updates, the most exciting aspect of Jetpack is how it can give users more control over what they see on a site, and how they can interact with its content. Like Ubiquity (another Mozilla Labs project), it also appears to be putting these add-ons right in the hands of users as soon as they visit a site with Jetpack controls, which means there's less of a need to promote it in an add-ons directory to have users find it.

Raskin warns that at version 0.1, the project is still a little rough. You can try out a few code samples, and read more about how to get involved, on the Jetpack developer site.",html

Now the company has invited the other major browsers to the party.

In addition to handling Firefox 3.6 and higher, the plug-in check page now supports Microsoft's Internet Explorer 7 and 8, Google Chrome 4, Opera 10.5, and Apple's Safari 4. All the browsers are compatible with the plug-in check. But Mozilla cautions in its official blog that IE 7 and 8 need specific code written for each plug-in, so full support of Microsoft's browser will take a bit longer.

The plug-in check page looks at all the plug-ins currently installed in your browser and alerts you to their status. If the plug-in is the latest version, you'll get a thumbs up that it's up to date. If not, the page offers you an update link that takes you to the plug-in vendor's Web site where you can download the newest edition.

Plugins are sometimes blamed as a source of stability and security issues for Web browers, so Mozilla designed the plug-in check to help reduce those risks. Since debuting the plug-in check page last October, Mozilla believes it's making a difference. The blog noted that Mozilla is now seeing 60 percent of its users with the latest version of Adobe's Flash plug-in and believes that's due to the new page.

I tried the plug-in page on the five major browsers. The results were similar in each. The page found some plug-ins that were up to date and one or two that needed to be updated. But it also found several that it couldn't detect and told me I'd need to research those myself.

In the blog, Mozilla does acknowledge that its Plug-in Directory, its database of plug-ins, is still in alpha stage, just one step beyond beta. The company is looking for help from developers to update this directory as new versions of their plug-ins are released and older versions become too risky to run.",html

Google announced Chrome 10's stable release on its blog but refrained from mentioning its product number. That's in line with the company's effort to focus on features rather than version numbers, which it calls mere milestones. Google tries to get new versions into users' hands as rapidly as possible and currently passes a new milestone about once every six weeks.

JavaScript is the programming language used to write Web-based programs, and it's steadily gaining in importance. That's because programmers are now using it to write full-featured Web applications such as Gmail and Google Docs, not just Web pages, and faster JavaScript enables more features and a faster interface.

Chrome 10 comes with the ""Crankshaft"" version of the V8 browser engine that Google pegs as 66 percent faster than the unnamed version in Chrome 9 as measured with Google's V8 Benchmark suite. That's a major speed boost, but be aware there are many other attributes of browser performance, and one of the biggest--hardware acceleration--will hit prime time with the imminent release of Mozilla's Firefox 4 and Microsoft's IE9.

Chrome 10 gets some hardware acceleration, though, when it comes to playing videos, said Chrome team member Jason Kersey in a blog post.

Browsers usually get new features, but, unusually, Chrome had one removed: H.264 video is gone. Google said Chrome 10 would support Google's own VP8 video encoding, which it offers royalty-free in an attempt to unencumber Web video from patent licensing barriers that come with the widely used H.264. For those who are attached to the codec, Microsoft offers an H.264 Chrome plug-in for Windows 7 users.

Chrome already had Adobe's Flash Player built in, but Chrome 10 also puts Flash in a protective sandbox to confine security problems to a walled-off area of memory. Also in the security department are 23 security fixes discovered through Google's Chrome bounty program and ranging in severity from low to high.

One seemingly minor but actually pretty useful change in Chrome 10 is a revamped configuration system. Instead of a pop-up dialog box that must be dealt with then closed, the new settings show in a browser tab.

The first advantage of the approach is that there's more room to show what's going on. The second is that you can leave the settings open while using other tabs--for example while reading Web sites that are offering advice on what to do. A third is that you can save specific Web addresses for a configuration setting, which Google believes could make remote tech support easier because you can simply e-mail somebody a URL rather than tell them how to drill down through a number of settings. Finally, a feature that comes along for the ride is that the configuration page comes with a search box to locate particular features directly.

Update 10:40 a.m. PT: Added information about Chrome 10 supporting VP8 video encoding and putting Flash in a protective sandbox. Updated 1:53 p.m. PT: Added information about Chrome 10's hardware acceleration for video and security fixes and about Microsoft's H.264 plug-in.",html

Google's Chrome edged up to about a quarter Firefox's share of global Web browser usage in March, a gain that outpaced its major rivals.

Chrome increased from 5.6 percent to 6.1 percent share of the browser usage from February to March, according to preliminary Net Applications statistics released Thursday. The company monitors and analyzes browser usage on a large network of Web sites.

Firefox also rose from 24.2 percent to 24.5 percent, and Safari also gained from 4.5 percent to 4.7 percent.

Opera was flat at 2.4 percent. Microsoft's Internet Explorer, though still the top browser by far in terms of usage, continued its steady decline with a drop from 61.6 percent to 60.7 percent.

The browser market is getting fiercely competitive. Safari and Chrome are joined at the hip by virtue of their common usage of the open-source WebKit foundation, but Chrome developers are pushing ahead as fast as possible.

Mozilla's Firefox had been the primary alternative browser of choice for those who wanted to move beyond Internet Explorer. Its share gains have leveled out with the arrival of Chrome, though, which has appealed to the same techno-savvy audience. Firefox is responding with new features and a new focus on performance, but the most interesting new dynamic in the browser wars is the awakening of Microsoft's slumbering IE giant.

On Wednesday, Mozilla offered an alternative quantitative view in its first Mozilla Metrics Report.

Mixing in statistics from four organizations--StatCounter, Quantcast, Gemius, and Net Applications--Mozilla concluded it's faring better than the Net Applications figures alone. ""Firefox's worldwide market share [is] hovering near 30 percent,"" the organization said.

One other interesting statistic from a Mozilla usage study: ""We found that the typical user has between two and three tabs open at any one time,"" though in the weeklong test one user had more than 600 tabs open.",html

Those of you who've ever accidentally shared a Facebook update with the entire world now have a better safety net in place.

As of Thursday, Facebook has changed the default audience for updates for new members. Instead of being shared with the entire public by default, updates will be shared only with friends. And just how does that work?

When you post an update on Facebook you can choose who you want to see it -- friends, only yourself, or the public. And by public, Facebook means a lot of people, specifically ""people who are not your friends, people off of Facebook, and people who view content through different media (new and old alike) such as print, broadcast (television, etc.) and other sites on the Internet.""

The new default setting applies to new people who join Facebook. But any member can switch the default setting for all updates and choose a specific audience for each update individually. Facebook users can also change the audience for any of their prior updates.

""First time posters will also see a reminder to choose an audience for their first post, and if they don't make a choice, it will be set to Friends,"" the social network explained on Thursday.

To protect you further, Facebook announced a new privacy checkup tool. Scheduled to roll out over the next few weeks, this new tool will help you review key settings, such as who can see your updates and which Facebook apps you use.

Facebook's move is certainly good news for any member who ever shared the wrong thing with the wrong crowd.",html

The next time someone suggests that open source can't innovate, is not user-friendly, etc., point them to Adium. It's simply incredible.

What Adium isn't, however, is a good Twitter client. That's about to change, starting with Adium's next version (1.4), when sophisticated Twitter functionality will be integrated into Adium.

Sure, it has been possible to integrate Adium with Twitter with things like TwitterAdium, but those have involved a little more heavy lifting than most users want to give to their desktop applications.

Now, as Adium has announced, this leading instant-messaging client is about to get serious Twitter integration, which is no mean feat, considering that Twitter shut down IM access in 2008 and has no announced plans to resurrect it.

The integration is accomplished using Matt Gemmell's MGTwitterEngine, a library used to communicate with the Twitter API. While the service won't initially be as full-featured as, say, TweetDeck, it sounds like a great first attempt at replicating the basic Twitter functionality in an IM client. Full details on how it will work are on the Adium blog.

Here's what the service is expected to look like. I can't wait. Much of my day is spent in both Twitter and Adium. Now I may simply spend time in Adium. You can follow me on Twitter at mjasay.",html

http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-57398501-12/android-antivirus-apps-not-as-bad-as-feared/,Android antivirus apps improve their grades--just not very much,"March,Pm,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"A redo of an AV-Test.org report that originally found fewer than 50 percent of Android antivirus apps effective at stopping mobile threats now grades six apps higher than before. Unfortunately, that's not much of an improvement.

In an update published earlier this week, AV-Test.org CEO Andreas Marx explained that ""certain parts in our initial report and the testing methodology [were] considered imprecise and/or flawed by third parties."" The revised rankings now list 23 effective apps in 41 tested, or 56 percent. That's up from 17 of 41 in the previous rankings.

Because of the complexity of Android malware, AV-Test focused on an app's ability to block families of malware as opposed to individual threats. It came up with five tiers of effectiveness, which I'm calling ""levels"" for simplicity. Level 1 detected 90 percent or more of the malware; Level 2 detected 65 percent to 90 percent; Level 3 only found 40 to 65 percent; Level 4 saw zero to 40 percent; and Level 5 detected zero percent.

Three antivirus apps joined the original seven that Marx graded effectiveness at Level 1. McAfee Mobile Security, MYAndroid Protection's MYMobile Security, and NQ Mobile's NetQin have now been rated as highly as Avast, Lookout, Dr. Web, Zoner, F-Secure, Ikarus, and Kaspersky. McAfee and NetQin jumped from a failing grade in the 40 to 65 percent effective category, while MYMobile Security moved from a zero percent score.

In a prepared statement about the report's update, MYMobileSecurity CEO Kevin Freij said, ""When we approached AV-Test.org with our observations they acted swiftly and professionally. They decided to look into our findings and quickly responded with an update.""

The original set of Level 2 apps included AVG, Bitdefender, ESET, Norton (Symantec,) QuickHeal, Trend Micro, Vipre (GFI,) Webroot, AegisLab and SuperSecurity. Three more--Bullguard, Comodo, and Total Defense--were upgraded to this level from Level 3.

Marx noted in his revised findings that Bitdefender, ESET, Trend Micro and Vipre missed Level 1 by just a few samples. ""The average family detection rate for these four products was in the area of 88.1 percent to 89.9 percent,"" he wrote.

The updated results found no other changes in ranking. Overall, Marx stood by his conclusions that with few exceptions, the most effective Android antivirus apps are those made by companies with Windows security programs.

As we can see by this re-test correction, even groups that have the most noble of testing intentions make mistakes. Besides, it can be risky relying on single-source benchmarks. Still, as AV-Test provides a momentary snapshot of Android security apps in the early days of the Android malware scene, I find that applying the Windows security equation is a good way to get the right answer to your Android antivirus app question. Choose a top-rated app that you trust and find easy to use is more important than choosing the absolute top-rated app of the moment.",html

PRAGUE--The city of Brno in the Czech Republic is a place people go to learn. Situated some 130 miles southeast of Prague, its 11 universities host approximately 80,000 students, many of whom are computer engineers. So it's no surprise that while AVG's corporate offices are headquartered back in Prague, Brno hosts the lifeblood of the company: the virus lab.

Although consumer computer security has grown tremendously in the past five years--with nearly all the major security suite makers including some form of community-based protection, URL verification, or phishing prevention to accompany more traditional tools like firewalls and antispam measures--antivirus detection remains the quintessential PC security feature.

AVG's Brno office is located in an complex that also hosts computer security vendorTrustPort, as well as a home appliance manufacturer. In most ways, the AVG offices on the sixth floor could be the offices of any software company. There's a game room with foosball and table hockey; a small library with muted lighting; a playroom for the children of AVG employees; and relaxation spaces designed to resemble places not often seen in the heart of central Europe, like beaches festooned with hammocks. The walls of one of the eating areas has been painted to resemble a Starbucks, complete with a massive Starbucks logo.

Two floors down, the only indications that you've arrived at the virus lab are the raft of warnings plastered to the door. Yellow caution tape and printed flyers emblazoned with the biohazard icon make the lab stand out from the rest of the conference rooms and offices. Of course, computer viruses have yet to actually pose a threat to your biological health, but the point is clear: The lab is restricted. Omezený, in Czech.

Inside, security analysts sit in high-backed chairs at Dell computers running Windows 7, and except for what's being displayed on their screens, the scene again returns to one of abject normality. The work that they're doing, however, is of paramount importance to your computer's security.

Karel Obluk, AVG's Chief Scientist, said that people tend to underestimate the speed at which threats appear and disappear. ""There's more to do than calculate checksums,"" he said. Also known as a hash sum, a checksum is a number generated by running a file through a tool designed to create checksums. The number is fixed, and changes if any of the data inside the file changes. A virus that alters a file will alter its checksum, so many antivirus programs today will generate checksums for every file on your hard drive, and then whitelist them unless it detects a change.

Obluk added that there are more than 40,000 new viruses a day. ""We do keep up, but not by processing each and individual sample."" AVG's automation takes over here, leaving about 50 samples per day per researcher. The company employs 25 analysts in Brno, and has five in China dedicated specifically to malware originating from there.

And make no mistake, the threat to your computer isn't really about disrupting you or your life. The bad guys just want your CPU and bandwidth to make money. ""A typical botnet can generate $11,000 per day, on less than 10,000 computers,"" said Obluk. The business of being a bad guy is so lucrative, he added, that malware writers have taken out ads in online forums not just for engineers, but for user interface designers, office managers, and accountants.

How the good guys stop the malware

The short version of how malware gets stopped from infecting your computer is quite simple, according to Pavel Krcma, the head of AVG's virus lab. First, the virus sample gets collected. It comes either via a user submission, is picked up by AVG's protection algorithm, or is shared from another virus labs. Whereas on the business and marketing side the security software industry can be brutal, the analysts and other members of the research and protection side communicate regularly, Krcma said.

Once the sample is in the lab, the next step is create a checksum signature for the sample. This then gets checked against the existing database of checksums to ensure that its not actually a legitimate file, known as a false positive.

Assuming it is malicious, the next step is a bit ""like undressing the virus,"" said Jirí Bracek, AVG's director of Security Engineering. The easiest way to see whether a file contains malicious code is to create an entropy map of it, he said, but because the files are almost always encrypted they have to rely on an emulator.

""We put it in a 64-bit Windows emulator, and we have a script emulator. Mostly malware scripts are obfuscated, and it's the obfuscation that prevents us from using hashes or regular expressions, so we use the emulator to reveal it,"" he explained. Citing proprietary information, however, Bracek wouldn't reveal precisely how the emulator works.

Inside the file's binary code there are three sections: A .text section for executable code, the part that sends instructions to the processor; the .data contains file data; and the .rsrc, which contains icons and other resources. ""We can see healthy code in the binary because healthy code has uniform lengths of jumps, they are organized,"" said Bracek. ""Malware code sometimes has code in different sections, such as .reloc or .rsrc. Malware also has code with chaotic jumps.""

Once a file has been positively identified as a threat, the researcher generates a checksum for it and updates the database. The update then goes out to AVG's more than 110 million active users.

All told, from the point that AVG receives a suspected new threat to the point where the malware is blocked and that data is pushed out to AVG users around the world, the process takes about five minutes, said Krcma. The analysts are quite adept at what they do, he added. ""It takes about one minute per piece of malware.""

Seth Rosenblatt/CNET

Not all threats can be detected using entropy maps. For example, rogue antivirus programs, also known as fake antiviruses, can't be detected using entropy maps, because those kinds of threats behave normally. The recent MacDefender attack was a rogue antivirus. Bracek explained that for rogue antiviruses, AVG instead looks at other characteristics that might be more likely to stand out.

Where the threats come from

""About 10 percent of attacks are coming from USB sticks,"" said Obluk, which leaves the Internet for the lion's share. But what does that mean? AVG's researchers are seeing a mixed bag of social engineering, rogue antiviruses, and traditional viruses and botnets.

Premium SMS is also a problem, and Obluk cited an AVG study that found that 8 percent of about 2,200 sampled U.S.-based smartphone users said premium SMS scams had happened to them. A premium SMS scam is where a rogue process gets your phone to send a text message to a number that charges for the receipt of the message. Premium SMS has been used to help donate money to victims of natural disasters and to relief organizations, but instead of a $10 donation, the premium SMS scammers use smaller denominations to avoid detection, Obluk said, because a $1 variance in your phone bill tends not to stand out to people the way a larger charge would.

Another big problem on smartphones, he said, is URL spoofing, because a phone's smaller browser makes it harder to read the location bar.

But Obluk cautioned that socially engineered threats--the threats that con people into giving up sensitive data--are the hardest to prevent and the hardest to inculcate against. ""Mac and Linux and Windows are generally secure. It's usually the user that's the weakest link.""",html

LAS VEGAS--Google touts the Chrome OS as being free from traditional security concerns like malware, but it's still vulnerable to entirely different kinds of attacks, two researchers from the firm WhiteHat Security told Black Hat attendees here today.

The Chrome OS is unlike any other desktop system currently available, said Matt Johansen, WhiteHat Security's team lead. ""It's more similar to mobile devices and apps, where to get more out of the device you're going to need to install extensions,"" he said. ""Mobile bugs are being sold for 20 to 30 percent more than desktop bugs because if you own somebody's phone you own their life.""

Unlike Apple, though, there's no review process, which in turn increases the security risk, said Kyle Osborn, an application security specialist focusing on offensive security for WhiteHat Security.

""We actually saw an extension in the Chrome Web Store called Cookie Stealer that did precisely that. But hey, it had the checkmark next to it that it was verified safe and secure,"" Johansen quipped.

When the Cr-48 demo laptop running Chrome OS first came out in December 2010, Google approached WhiteHat Security to find security risks in the OS. They quickly found a hole in the ScratchPad note-taking app, which could affect all Chrome OS users since it's one of the few apps that comes pre-installed.

When you take notes with ScratchPad, it syncs the note to your Google Docs account. What most people didn't realize about Google Docs is that the person you share a document or folder with doesn't have to approve receiving it. It just automatically appears in your Docs. This lack of structured permissions massively increased the risk of running an exploit, said Johansen, because it affects everybody, it has access to your Google log-in and there's no permissions wall to break through.

The risk is even worse than that, said Osborn. ""Because it has access to all sub-domains under Google.com, this could include your contacts or Voice account. An exploit could export your entire contact list as a CSV,"" he said, simply because you were using a Google-written app.

""This is a zero-click, or at max a one-click worm,"" said Johansen. He said that Google was quick to fix the exploit once his company notified them, but the larger point of open permissions left Chrome OS users vulnerable. Along with permissions, he said that the very API list which allowed extension writers to create powerful tools also led to serious security risks. In the list of APIs that extensions have access to is the one for Tabs, which means that an exploit could easily gain access to your entire browsing session.

""Of course, your note-taking extension is going to have to talk to your Google Docs account, or your banking extension will have to talk to your bank,"" Johansen said, and Osborn added that he's found extensions that have access to all Chrome APIs, including bookmarks, cookies, history, windows, and tabs. ""There's no need to inject code into google.com if you have access to these APIs,"" he said.

""This affects mobile, too. A new feature of the Android Market is that you can log in with your Google account and install apps [from the desktop to the phone]. We can now force the download and install of any application that we want,"" said Osborn.

In a statement, a Google spokesperson responded: ""This conversation is about the Web, not Chrome OS. Chromebooks raise security protections on computing hardware to new levels. They are also better equipped to handle the Web attacks that can affect browsers on any computing device, thanks in part to a carefully designed extensions model and the advanced security available through Chrome that many users and experts have embraced.""

When it comes to Chrome app-based threats, Osborn and Johansen are not looking for usual suspects, such as Microsoft Office exploits or buffer overflows. They're looking at things like e-mail notifiers, note-taking apps, and RSS readers, which have to have wide-open permissions to run properly. Basically, they said, they're looking at any extension that talks to a database, or any extension that takes input from somewhere and displays it to the user.

""Why worry about native code execution when cross-site scripting [attacks] gives hackers access to all. Exploit development is hard. JavaScript is easy,"" Johansen said, eliciting chuckles from the audience.

However, they also had good things to say about Chrome as an operating system. Osborn noted a recent blog post by Google on how to write extensions for Chrome more securely, and Johansen said certain features in Chrome OS did make the computer safer. These included better-known protections such as sandboxing tabs so they didn't ""talk"" to each other and removing nearly all local storage, but he also pointed out that the operating system handles its own plug-ins, restricts the ""attack surface"" to client-side browser exploits, and eliminates most modern virus and malware threats. Also, he said, the Chrome Web Store is segregated from everything else, which means that it's hard to launch an attack through the store itself.

The issue of permissions is complicated because it basically turns the end user into a firewall. Although the program, app, or extension tells you when you install it which permissions it requires, the act of blocking those falls to the user. ""Whose problem is it with these permissions? Is it Google's? The developer's?"" Johansen asked the crowd.

He added that Google has been responsive and open in talking with his company about these problems. ""We would like to see more restrictive APIs in the future,"" he concluded.

Apple's iPhone 6 might be unveiled sooner than expected, a new report claims.

Apple will show off its new iPhone 6 at an event in August and release the device that same month, Taiwan-based Economic Daily News reported on Friday, citing people who claim to have knowledge of Apple's plans.

Whatever the case, all of the rumors surrounding the iPhone seem to line up on one point: screen size. Nearly every recent report says that Apple will launch a 4.7-inch iPhone 6, as well as a .

""With this transaction, Intuit will gain another fast-growing consumer brand and a highly successful Software as a Service (SaaS) offering that helps people save and make money,"" Intuit CEO Brad Smith said in a statement Monday. ""This move will enhance Intuit's position as a leading provider of consumer SaaS offerings that connect customers across desktop, online and mobile.""

TechCrunch reported the deal Sunday night, citing unnamed sources.

Mint, a start-up launched two years ago that tracks personal finance data, became a CNET Webware 100 winner in 2008 and again in 2009. It was also the 2007 winner of the TechCrunch50, which kicks off once again Monday in San Francisco.

Mint's features have apparently helped it attract a younger, more diverse demographic than Intuit's Quicken Online. Mint founder and CEO Aaron Patzer told CNET News last year that 40 percent of his company's users are women. He claimed Quicken's demographic was still ""85 percent men."" Assuming that's true, it would appear that Intuit can significantly expand its base with the Mint acquisition.

When the deal is made final, Mountain View, Calif.-based Mint will become part of Intuit's Consumer Group, which includes both Quicken and TurboTax. Patzer will become general manager of Intuit's Personal Finance group.

Although Mint and Intuit's Quicken Online are direct competitors, Intuit said it plans to maintain both products. According to Intuit, they serve ""separate and equally important purposes.""

http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10029914-2.html,"Google 'starting from scratch' with own browser, Chrome",,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Update at 2:36 p.m. PDT: It's official: Google Chrome will be available Tuesday.

Word surfaced Monday of a Web ""comic book"" introducing Google Chrome, the search giant's long-rumored open-source browser project. While the illustrations, created by cartoonist Scott McCloud, were not announced by Google, they do contain the quotes and likenesses of 19 Google developers.

Google Blogoscoped

The detailed, 38-page comic appeared on Google Blogoscoped, an unofficial Google blog. Update: The comic is now available on Google Book Search. The book is broken down into five main sections covering stability; speed; search and the user experience, security, and standards. Here are the key features, according to the book:

Google Blogoscoped

Stability

Each tab will run in its own process. These processes will be completely isolated from each other, will be killable from the operating system's process manager, and will be sandboxed to prevent them from accessing information on the user's computer. This architecture should lead to a more stable and more consistent browsing experience--performance of the browser should not degrade over time.

Google is using its search index to prioritize testing of the browser--the pages that are linked to the most from Google Search are getting the most automated hits to make sure Chrome is behaving correctly on them.

Speed

The browser is being written with WebKit, the open-source engine at the core of Apple's Safari and Google's Android. The browser is also getting a new Javascript virtual machine, V8. It's said to be a better solution for complex and rich Web applications--it should yield better performance as well as ""smoother drag and drops"" in interactive applications.

Search and user experience

In Chrome, browser tabs will take over the interface, becoming the primary navigational element. Each tab will get its own window controls. Users will be able to tear off tabs into standalone windows. (Related: developers will be able to control which window controls appear in a tab, creating, if they wish, Web applications that are embedded in a browser but that appear to be more like traditional desktop apps.)

Chrome's URL entry field will be called the ""Omnibox,"" and, like Mozilla's ""Awesome bar,"" will feed you suggestions based on your browsing history and live search results. It will be respectful of users, the comic says: ""Inline completions will never flicker, never flash. It's perfect, aesthetically non-distracting.""

Google Blogoscoped

The browser's default start page will show thumbnails of the user's most frequently visited pages and a list of their top searches. There will also be a private browsing mode, as IE 8 has.

Security

Chrome's architecture lends itself to secure browsing. Each Web page, or tab, runs in its own process, and is blocked from accessing other processes on the computer. ""We've taking the existing process boundary,"" the comic says, ""and made it into a jail."" Different and more flexible permissions are being developed for plug-ins, however.

A database and API to access phishing and scam sites will be used in Chrome (and made public), which will hopefully reduce ""zero-day"" scam exploits. The browser will be constantly updated with this information.

Standards

The browser will be released as an open-source project. Also, Google will build the open-source local runtime Gears into the browser, and is hoping that it is taking up widely to ""improve the base functionality of all browsers.""

Yes, this is big

CNET News.com Editor in Chief Dan Farber's analysis of Google Chrome Monday was this: ""It would be in line with other Google open-source projects, such as OpenSocial and Google Gears. Creating a competitor to Firefox, as well as Internet Explorer and Opera, could spur more innovation.""

""Open sourcing the code is a smart way to avoid the 'Google wants to take over the world' fear, but it seems that Google has ambitions to create a comprehensive Internet operating system, including a browser, applications, middleware and cloud infrastructure.""

Google Blogoscoped

No official confirmation from Google yet, although Kara Swisher of All Things D cites sources who say that Google will make a Chrome download available to users by as early as tomorrow.

The new iPad, which is virtually identical to the iPad Air 2, come equipped with one significant upgrade: a A9 processor. Priced at $329 (£339 or AU$469) for the 32GB Wi-Fi model and $459 (£469 or AU$669) for the 32GB model with Wi-Fi and 4G LTE connectivity, it's the least expensive iPad in Apple's lineup, now that the Mini 2has been discontinued. The company has also given a modest makeover to the Mini 4, which starts at $399 and is now Apple's thinnest and lightest iPad, but left the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models unchanged -- for now.

1:22 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF

The iPad Air 2 review, published in November 2015 and updated regularly since, follows.

Editors' note: On September 7, 2016, Apple gave a storage boost to its lineup of iPads, increasing the base storage capacity of the iPad Air 2, iPad Mini 4 and iPad Mini 2 from 16GB to 32GB. Though the company discontinued the 64GB edition of the iPad Air 2, the 128GB version remains available and is now $100 cheaper than before ($499 without cellular connectivity and $629 with it).

When Apple introduced the 9.7-inch iPad Pro on March 21, 2016, it seized the mantle of best iPad ever. The spitting image of the celebrated iPad Air 2, this smaller sibling of the original iPad Pro brings to the table a marvelous combination of form factor perfection and cutting-edge specs. Noteworthy features include a blazing fast processor; killer cameras (front and rear); an enhanced, antireflective display; and support for Apple's Pencil and Smart Keyboard. With a near-perfect balance between tablet power and portability, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is pricy, sure, starting at $599 -- but also the new gold standard in the tablet category.

That noted, the iPad Air 2, the progenitor of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro design, remains arguably the better value. As of September 2016, the 32GB iPad Air 2 costs $200 less than the 32GB iPad Pro and has virtually everything a conventional user needs in a tablet. With a keyboard accessory, it's a great portable writing tool -- unlike the iPad Mini 2 and Mini 4, which are both just a tad too small for keyboards. Its screen is well-suited to watching movies. And it handles multitasking a bit better than the Mini 4.

As Scott Stein suggests in his review of the iPad Pro, this may be why Apple put the ""Pro"" in the iPad Pro -- these high-performance models are not for everyone. Yes, they're fast -- and especially great for creative professionals who are going to use their Pencil add-ons. But the upgrades come with a hefty price tag, and many folks would be better off spending that amount of money on a nice laptop.

Given this, the iPad Air 2 is still the Goldilocks in Apple's tablet lineup. We awarded it a CNET Editors' Choice in October 2014, and we heartily re-endorse it now, more than two years later.

Editors' note: The original iPad Air 2 review, which follows, has been updated to reflect the existence of the iPad Pro and 9.7-inch iPad Pro.

Perfect size for reading, writing and viewing

The real reason I recommend the Air 2 over all other iPads is it strikes the perfect balance between a reading/playing/viewing tablet and something a bit more productive. It can be carried pretty easily in one hand and feels like reading a softcover book. Magazines and feature articles look good on its screen. Movies -- even letterboxed ones -- look sharp. But it's big enough to do some work on. Apps run side-by-side in splitscreen (Split View) mode work well, and with a keyboard attached it's a solid portable writing machine. My favorite case right now is Belkin's QODE Ultimate Pro -- it offers protection, a great backlit keyboard and two different tilt angles. With one of these on, the iPad Air 2 is nearly a tiny laptop without a trackpad, and a great emergency device to always have on me.

Even after weeks with the larger iPad Pro, the Air 2 seems fine to me. It even seems cozier and a lot more portable.",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-10438513-12.html,Opera 10.50 preview crawls forward,"January,Pm,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Opera 10.50 earned another public pre-alpha version, but this one is for Windows users only so far.

Originally announced in December, the significantly faster preview build of what's to come for the browser doesn't introduce any major new features, but it does include several important bug fixes from the last pre-alpha build.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Included in Opera 10.50 pre-alpha 3199 are upgrades to the new core rendering engine, which looks in preliminary testing to bring Opera's rendering speeds at least to parity with Google Chrome. Windows 7 integration and video support have been improved, while support for IMAP compress and context menu support for ""inspect element"" have been added. Several mail issues and other common crashes have also been addressed.

Mac and Linux versions of the new build haven't been released yet, and the publisher has pointed out two known major bugs: a lower score on the Acid3 rendering test than in Opera 10.10, and a Document Object Model, or DOM, regression. Opera expects both to be fixed by the next release. In the blog post announcing the new build, Opera also put out a public call for more bug reporting.",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-10411854-12.html,Mozilla lets Thunderbird 3 fly,"December,Pm,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Mozilla Messaging pushed the stable release of Thunderbird 3 out of the nest on Tuesday, and there's a lot to like in case you haven't been following the beta development of this Outlook alternative. The long-overdue Thunderbird 3 is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, and it introduces several hefty new features and some long-needed improvements, including an overhauled search and message indexing, tab support, and a revamped setup wizard that's designed to make new account setup quick and painless.

One feature that isn't included is the calendaring add-on, Lightning. Originally, Mozilla had planned to bake the extension into the program, but decided back in February 2009 to change course and leave it up to users to download. Although Thunderbird natively comes with Microsoft Exchange support, there's no calendar and therefore no meeting support in the default Thunderbird installation. Along with Lightning, there's an essential Google Calendar add-on for Lightning that gives Google users calendar support in Lightning. Currently, the only version of Lightning that works in Thunderbird 3 is the nightly build, available here.

Even without Lightning, Thunderbird makes for an excellent desktop-based e-mail client. Beyond Outlook replacement, it also makes a savvy offline or local-storage tool for the various Web mail providers. Gmail integration has existed in Thunderbird for a while, but improvements in version 3 include better recognition and integration of Gmail's special folders. These include Sent and Trash, and the non-English versions of Gmail. The All Mail option in Gmail defaults in Thunderbird to the Archives folder.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Undeniably, the killer feature in Thunderbird 3 is the search. The most obvious competitor, Microsoft Outlook, doesn't offer anything that comes close to the level of granular control that Mozilla has given Thunderbird users. The new search bar is dominant at the top of the interface, and is set by default to search all messages. When you search, a new tab will open with your results organized as shown in the screenshot above. Filters based on e-mail addresses, folders, and tags appear on the left, while the majority of the window is given over to displaying summaries of the e-mails that meet your criteria. There's also a timeline bar graph at the top of the results. Click it, and then mouse over any of the subcategories to see how they occurred over time.

You can change the search box to one of several filters, including Subject, From, Recipient, To, CC, and Message Body. Frustratingly, you can't filter by Tag. You can also save any of these filtered searches as a virtual folder. Editors' note: The previous two paragraphs have been rewritten for clarity.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

There is one drawback to the search: the first time it indexes your messages, you're potentially in for a long, long wait. In testing, this depended entirely on the number of messages in your folders. High volume accounts, whether locally archived or all on a server, should probably set their indexing to run overnight. After the first indexing, each new e-mail is added as it comes in.

E-mails open by default into new tabs, making the e-mail reading experience far more similar to the Web-browsing one. This can be toggled under the Advanced section of the Options, under the Reading and Display tab. The hot keys for the e-mail tabs have been mapped the same as in Firefox, so middle-click an e-mail to open it in a new tab but retain your focus on the current tab. The CTRL+Tab hot key combo will cycle through your tabs, and there's an open tab button on the right side of the tab bar to help manage your tabs.

There's a new activity manager that records all interactions between your e-mail provider and Thunderbird, making it easier to track down errors when you send or receive mail. There's also an entirely new system for archiving messages based on Gmail's ""archive and forget it"" method. The new version offers the traditional multiple-folder-based solution, as well as the new dumping-ground style, which can be activated via the ""A"" hot key. Thunderbird 3 supports Firefox personas, too, further reinforcing their shared architecture.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Other changes include major code improvements. The setup wizard now looks to mozillamessaging.com for additional information on how to configure the account. This changes how new Web mail accounts are created. Mozilla has said that only the domain name from your e-mail address gets sent to Mozilla's servers, and that the entire process falls under the Mozilla's privacy policy. Nevertheless, it's a move that's likely to cause some concern among privacy advocates.

The compact header mode has been deleted, which is sure to annoy those who like using Thunderbird on smaller-form computers like Netbooks. Windows users should see Thunderbird results appearing in federated searches in Windows Vista and Windows 7, while Mac users will find Growl notification support for new e-mails, integration with Spotlight and the Mac OS X address book, and support for Mail.app. The full changelog for Thunderbird 3 can be read here.

Thunderbird 3 rates as a top-notch e-mail client, and it's definitely the best freeware one around. It will require some fidgeting to get it to be usable in a corporate environment, but it's far more scalable to user needs than anything else currently available.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20024520-264.html,Google elevates PDF reading in Chrome 8,,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Google helped make Adobe Systems' PDF files a first-class citizen on the Web years ago by indexing their content with its search engine. Now it's gone another step by building the ability to read them into its latest browser, Chrome 8, released yesterday for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

That means when people click a PDF link, the document will open directly in the browser. Chrome's built-in PDF reader is also walled up within a sandbox, lowering the risk that security issues will escape a confined region of memory to facilitate a broader attack on a computer.

The PDF reader is among 800 improvements in Chrome 8, including 12 security fixes, according to a blog post yesterday by Chrome team member Jason Kersey. Google paid out $1,000 to each of three discoverers of high-risk vulnerabilities and $500 to two discovers of medium-risk vulnerabilities.

Chrome 8 also is the first version to support the Chrome Web Store, Google has said. However, there aren't any direct signs yet that it's tapping into the upcoming Google service for finding and selling Web applications, Chrome extensions, and Chrome themes.

Adobe is working to improve PDF without Chrome, too. Its latest Reader 9 and Acrobat X software has a browser plug-in that hides the application frame that previously surrounded PDF documents viewed in a browser.

The new Chrome 8.0.552.215 replaces both the earlier beta and stable versions. It arrives just about six weeks after Google released Chrome 7; the faster release pace this year means new Chrome versions aren't necessarily as big of a departure from their predecessors. For those with a taste for cutting-edge features but less stability, there's the Chrome Dev channel, which is on the 9.x release version.

New for Windows users of Chrome Dev is a sandboxed version of Adobe's Flash Player, an oft-cited culprit in browser crashes and security vulnerabilities. Building Flash and PDF readers into Chrome means, among other things, that they will be upgraded rapidly and typically invisibly whenever Google wants to distribute a new version for performance, features, or security reasons.

Chrome's PDF reader appears to use the Foxit PDF SDK software, but the built-in Flash Player is from Adobe.

""For initial testing, the sandboxing code currently supports Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7. There are plans to make this available for all OS platforms once we are further along in testing and development,"" Adobe Flash team member Peleus Uhley said in a blog post this week. ""We hope that we can use this experience as a platform for discussing sandbox approaches with the other browser vendors.""

Also on tap for Chrome 9 is a lot of hardware acceleration work, including accelerated 3D graphics with the WebGL interface.",html
http://ces.cnet.com/8301-32254_1-20027864-283.html,"CES: BitTorrent plans torrenting ecosystem, hardware partnerships",,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"LAS VEGAS--The grandpappy of the torrenting world, BitTorrent, announced yesterday at the 2011 Consumer Electronics Show that it will bolster its torrent-managing software later this year with search and playback features. Similar to competitors such as Vuze and Miro, the ecosystem comes as part of the development of Project Chrysalis, an effort to give BitTorrent a more robust feature set and give consumers a seamless workflow from finding content to playing it back. BitTorrent recently announced that it had reached more than 100 million active monthly users.

BitTorrent

The new version of BitTorrent is due in a public beta near the end of the first quarter, according to BitTorrent Chief Strategist Shahi Ghanem. The impetus for the redesign, he said, is that BitTorrent is not easy for the average person to use. ""The capabilities of the client are limiting. It's not great at finding content, playing content, or shifting content,"" Ghanem said. He defined ""shifting"" content as the ability to easily move it from one device or format to another.

Through the addition of ""channels"" such as TED, Make, and contracts with musicians and filmmakers, users will be able to browse for new content more easily. You'll be able to rate torrents on the fly using a star system that will appear next to the torrent as it downloads.

You'll also be able to automatically transcode the torrented files from their original format into something that can be easily burned to disc or played back from within BitTorrent. To ensure that users know which devices support BitTorrent, Ghanem said that the company is working on two open standards for hardware. One will encompass what Ghanem described as ""connected,"" and includes processor, storage, and network support. The other is what he called a ""disconnected"" standard for burning.

To further that end, the company has partnered with Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), a leading high-tech research and development organization. Chips, designs, and devices that comply with these standards will be sold with green stickers bearing the BitTorrent logo and designated as BitTorrent Certified. Ghanem said that the goal is to enable people to transfer content seamlessly and effortlessly between their home computers, tablets, phones, and televisions.

The company is also working on two Android apps, expected in public beta at the same time as the new version of the desktop program. In a brief demo at CES, Ghanem showed working alpha versions of them and the new version of BitTorrent downloading a torrent on a desktop, then streaming it to an Android phone, a tablet, and on to a television.

Changes to BitTorrent have not always been received well by the torrenting cognoscenti, and so the company has promised that the uTorrent client will remain unaffected by the alterations made to the mainline BitTorrent.

BitTorrent protocol originator Bram Cohen demonstrated for me a project he's been working on for the past two years, currently called Project Pheon but eventually to be known as BitTorrent Live. The concept is simple: improve streaming live video, the way that BitTorrent improved the ability to share files. Cohen has reduced the latency of live streaming down to 3 to 5 seconds, and tested it against hundreds of thousands of simulated computers in a test environment. In the real world, he said that Project Pheon has worked with dozens of simultaneous connections.

The project faces serious hurdles, such as not being able to use TCP because the upload queue gets filled, or using timeouts because timeouts effectively kill the live stream. ""There's no reason this hasn't been done yet, but there aren't many people working in this space,"" he said. Project Pheon is based on UDP, the same basis for uTorrent's uTP, and is expected late in the second half of 2011.",html

FORUM POSTING SUGGESTING TOPIC---

So, Webware tells me that Comcast will CANCEL my service if I go over their new 250 GB limit twice (ever?).

And Comcast won't tell me how much I'm using until they threaten me the first time.

I use two online backup services Mozy (for backups), and Sugar Sync (so my work data is available to me from any location). My old computer died last month and I downloaded my 50 GB bacup from Mozy. Granted, that doesn't happen all the time, but you never know.

I download a bunch of podcasts every week (audio and video), etc....

So, can you guys review some of the available Bandwidth metering software out there? Free vs. paid? Mac vs Windows? (I have Vista 64 bit.

COMMENTS ON CHROME

""WebKit began when Apple Inc. created a software fork of the KDE project?s HTML layout engine KHTML and KDE's JavaScript engine (KJS). ""

Arthur Belle Dent

Nice job on the Chrome episode, Rafe. Question for you: For Chrome as an application platform to really change the OS paradigm, it would need to be bootable. As I think you mentioned, Linux would probably fill that bill. However, would there be any problem using Linux or a Linux-based version of Chrome to run what would be an ad-supported platform such as this? In other words, does that fact that Google would be using ad-support to derive income from the Chrome-based application launch platform create any problems with using Linux? Are there any prohibitions in the Linux terms of service for that kind of use?

Thanks, and again, nice job on the Chrome podcast.

Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, Google Chrome dev 5.0.342.1 comes with the geolocation API that Mozilla has supported since it introduced it in last summer's Firefox 3.5.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

However, geolocation in Chrome is turned off by default. To activate it, users must go to their Chrome shortcut and add --enable-geolocation to the end of the target line, under the Shortcut tab. To test if it's working, you can go to http://www.browsergeolocation.com. If the browser asks for you to approve sending your location data, you know it's working.

I found that on Windows 7, launching Chrome from the taskbar did not allow it to recognize the geolocation activation command. It worked fine, though, when launched from the Start menu.

This update to Chrome dev also includes a few other minor improvements, mostly to the Mac and Linux versions. Along with the geolocation support, users on those platforms should see improved plug-in stability and better implementation of autofill preferences. Mac users only should see favicons in the history menu, and HTML5 databases have been added to the cookie manager. The full list of changes can be read here.",html

You can sync bookmarks and export some data, but it's almost like starting over again. Thankfully, Download.com editor Jessica Dolcourt tipped me off to the Weave plug-in. Weave syncs your bookmarks, search queries, passwords, and even open tabs and then encrypts the data on Mozilla's servers. This can save a lot of time when you're setting up a new computer or if you browse the Web on more than one computer.

Now Playing: Watch this: Back up Firefox

If you're not comfortable with beta version software, you may want to wait on this, because you need to run the latest beta version of Firefox. Go to www.mozilla.com/firefox/all-beta.html to download the current version.

Install that browser, then go to labs.mozilla.com/projects/weave/ and download and install the Weave add-on. Once you've restarted the browser, choose Tools then Weave then sign-in.

If this is the second browser you're setting up, then you'll choose to set up another computer. If it's your first browser, you choose Get Started with Weave. Then you'll enter a username and password for your account and a separate passphrase for the encryption on Mozilla's servers. Don't forget that one, or you're kind of screwed.

You'll be challenged to figure out one of those crazy spam-preventing Captchas, then you'll need to tell Mozilla which computer this browser is on and what kind of computer it is. The first sync will happen and then you're done. You can tweak your preferences in the tools menu under Weave. After that, you just go to any other computer you want synced, and set up Weave on them. The process will be similar. You'll need to remember your username and password.

Weave will get even cooler when Firefox's mobile applications come out. You'll be able to sync your phone's Mozilla to your computer as well.",html

Which may be why the company is making available a public beta of its next major update to OS X, named El Capitan, in anticipation of its final release this fall.

Apple first gave us a glimpse of El Capitan in June at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference and this month offered a prerelease version to the public, allowing users to check out the progress of the upcoming OS. According to Apple, El Capitan is very much about refining the look and feel of OS X, from how you work with apps and search to how quickly apps open and display information.

Split View

For example, Split View is new in El Capitan and lets you fill your screen with two side-by-side app windows. That's a nice addition for when you are working on two documents, and it means you don't have to resize windows to fit next each other or click back and forth between app windows. To use Split View, click, hold, and then release the green full-screen button in a window's title bar to select your first window. Then in Mission Control, select your second window.

Mission Control

Mission Control gives you a quick way to see, arrange, and navigate between your open windows. In El Capitan, Mission Control gathers related windows together, so you can easily find a window associated with an app.

Spotlight

With El Capitan's Spotlight, you can get search results for sports, stocks, transit, and weather, as well as Web videos. And you can type your queries using natural language, so you shouldn't have to think too hard about how to phrase your questions to get the results you want.

Mail

Apple continues to polish its Mail app. In the update, swipe to mark an email as read or unread or to delete it. Mail also includes Smart Suggestions, a feature that looks for names and events in messages and prompts you to add them to your contacts or calendar.

Notes

The Notes apps gets a big boost in El Capitan. You can now drag photos, PDFs, videos, and other files into a note and save content -- such as a website or a map -- from other apps through the Share menu. It's also easy to create checklists. And the app does a nice job of working with iCloud, so your notes are synced across your Apple devices.

Photos

Photos, which formally replaced iPhoto earlier this spring, becomes more useful in El Capitan. You can add third-party editing extensions to the app, you can add location information to an image or an entire Moment, and you can sort albums by title and name as well as by date.

Safari

El Capitan's Safari lets you pin your your favorite websites on the browser's tab bar. Mute audio from a noisy tab with a mute button in the search field. To pin a tab, go up to Safari's Window menu and select Pin Tab.

Maps

Maps in El Capitan now has a Transit view that provides guidance for using a city's public transportation system. However, the public beta has transit info for a just a handful of cities. So I can get around the Bay Area, but if I search for a city without transit info, I get a message telling me information is not available.

Under the hood

Apple says it's working behind the scenes to make El Capitan feel snappier and more fluid. From faster app launching to quicker display of your first messages in Mail, Apple's focus is on making El Capitan more responsive. While it's tough to judge performance improvements in betas, with so many moving parts, the public beta feels solid and responsive.

A note of caution

Beta software can be finicky, with unexpected behavior and app incompatibilities. If you decide to install the public beta of El Capitan, take care: make you sure you have a current backup of everything and consider running the beta on a secondary machine or external hard drive, definitely not on your primary one.",html

Available Monday exclusively in North America from CNET Download.com, Kaspersky Internet Security 2011 and Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2011 make a good case to longtime Kaspersky users to stick with the company while giving new users enough to consider switching.

The new version of Kaspersky Internet Security 2011 includes a proprietary support tool that the company says will install on infected computers and then clean them well enough to then continue with the regular program installation. The suite also expands the SafeRun sandbox feature offered last year outside of the browser with SafeDesktop. As the name implies, it now protects the desktop as well so that you can install programs without running the risk of accidentally damaging your system or installing malware. There's new antiphishing measures in place, and in some cases, Kaspersky said, certain unapproved malicious actions can be undone thanks to changes made to the program's proactive defense system.

Other changes include a new Windows desktop gadget that pushes system security information to an easily viewed location and is customizable so users see only the data that's most important to them. New family-based protections include control over file downloads and video game usage, and a new location-based filter can be used to block incoming content from IP addresses on a per-country basis. Minor improvements in other parts of the program include being able to make not only a recovery CD, but also a recovery USB key. Improvements have been made to the reputation-based detection system, rootkit detection, and spam blocking.

Kaspersky Internet Security 2011 comes with a free 30-day trial, and a one-year license retails for $79.95. Kaspersky AntiVirus 2011 also comes with a free 30-day trial, and its one-year license retails for $59.95.

We previewed iOS 4.3 back in January, and now the time has almost come: the latest version of Apple's iOS software will be available March 11.

What's new this time around? Well, not as much as iOS 4.2, but there are some notable upgrades--especially if you're an iPad owner.

Support for additional multifinger multitouch gestures and swipes adds four-finger fast-swapping between open apps and a one-handed way to flick the app dock up, instead of double-clicking the home button. In fact, you'll probably be using that lone physical button a whole lot less now.

There's also a new app, Photo Booth, that will add tools for taking and tweaking self portraits, similar to what exist already on Mac OS X. Obviously, this app's limited to the camera-equipped iPad 2.

Home Sharing will allow other PC or Mac iTunes libraries with Home Sharing turned on to be accessible on your iPad, locally streamed.

Wi-Fi hot-spot support will finally enable AT&T iPhones to share their wireless connection with other devices, much like the Verizon iPhone 4 .

For Apple TV owners, there are some improvements to video streaming and AirPlay support. AirPlay will also support photo slideshows, as well as well video and audio streaming from third-party apps to other devices.

The built-in Safari browser should also see performance improvements running JavaScript, thanks to a new nitro JavaScript engine.

http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-10218606-12.html,"Trillian Astra's still alive, beta available","April,Pm,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Editors' note: At 2:30 p.m., April 14, we added information about the Instant Lookup feature and other in-chat features. Updated information can be found at the bottom of the post.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

The first of the multiprotocol chat clients, Trillian got its start nine years ago and had been updated with some regularity through 2005 and 2006. It was included in the Google Pack, a collection of freeware that Google was supporting. On the heels of Trillian 3.1, Cerulean Studios announced that Trillian 4, code-named Astra, was in development, and would finally port the service to Mac and Linux.

Except for the occasional minor announcement, that was the last big news about Trillian. Competition from more frequently updated services like Pidgin, Digsby, and Adium has drawn away fans, but now there's a private beta of Astra that seems to be accepting invitation requests from everybody who wants one. You can sign up for the Astra beta here--let us know if you don't get an invite, because it seems that Cerulean is taking all comers.

Back when it was announced, Astra sounded great. Support for even more chat protocols, better encryption protection, and a downloadable contact list were just a few of the tantalizing features. Facebook integration was added to the list, eventually, but by that time, many users had moved on. Astra, as it stands now, is good at what it does--but the competition has caught up.

It does everything that it should do at this point. It services multiple chat protocol, including mainstream services like Yahoo, AOL, Google, and ICQ. MySpaceIM is supported, and Skype is included, but it requires the program to be running before it can be accessed through Astra--just as Skype does with other multichat applications. It includes POP3 and IMAP account notifications rolled in alongside the Facebook and Web mail notices.

There are other useful tweaks and changes. By default, a pop-up window will appear when you receive a chat. Click on it once and you'll see two options, one for a standard Reply and the other for a Quick Reply. The Quick Reply will open a text field in the pop-up that you can write your response in, while hitting Reply will bring up the main chat window. Video chat and Webcam support are supported by default, and three view modes are available for changing up your chat window appearance.

Astra is extensible, and impressively only crashed once, when I was jumping from a Gmail notification to the actual mail message. When you install though, don't just cruise through the process on auto-pilot or you'll wind up with the Weather Channel toolbar and the Ask.com toolbar. Two other problems stuck out: the news ticker that appears at the top of the chat window can't be removed or even configured to run headlines that are useful to you, and the search function in the Options menu doesn't work. This makes it difficult to navigate through the overhaul, since many features have changed in the update.

It feels faster and smoother than previous versions of Trillian, but that's the least it should be, considering when its last update happened. The Astra skin feels slick and modern, but it can be a bit irritating at first as important features blend into the background because of a lack of contrasting colors. Overall, the experience feels smoother than I remember Trillian being, although I probably haven't touched it in about two years.

Trillian Astra is a good chat client, and it doesn't suffer from a ""too little, too late"" syndrome. This is a solid, modern multichat client. The question that won't be answered until it finally comes out, though, is whether anyone still cares.

Update: What I referred to above as the news ticker, Trillian calls the ""Instant Lookup."" It's accessible in Preferences under the Chat option. Users can configure which feeds or Instant Lookups appear, although that's not readily apparent. Click on an item to modify it and an X will appear on the right side. Click the X to remove the item, and remove all of them to remove the news ticker completely. You can add RSS feeds or ""lookup"" services using the buttons at the bottom of the window, but overall it's not an intuitive process. The X's could appear by default, for example, or there could be mouse-over instructions.

There's also a default feature that I neglected to point out that underlines in certain words green. Mouse over the word or phrase and the Wikipedia definitions will appear. Click on one of those words and a menu appears from which you can Copy the definition to the clipboard, Search for the term on the Web, or View the Wikipedia entry by loading the Wikipedia page. While the first and third options worked flawlessly, the Search feature took me to the Cerulean Studios Web page and tried to download an app without an extension.

I stand by my initial analysis of Astra's new features that while they're useful, they're hard to configure and some are still buggy or nonfunctional.",html

Isolator for Mac

Screen Workspaces

Sometimes one desktop isn't enough. If you don't have the luxury of multiple monitors or machines, these desktop workspace apps will help you spread out your work across multiple screens. This is especially handy for those who use laptops and notebooks as their primary workhorses.

Sysinternals Desktops for Windows

Mac: Use Mission Control

Cloud Storage

One of the more obvious benefits of using cloud storage services like Dropbox and Drive is the ability to access your files from anywhere with an Internet connection. Such features are especially appropriate for the work environment, whether you're at home, in the office, or on the go. Most of the more popular services come with free introductory tiers that start with 2-5GB of storage, as well as premium tiers for larger files.

Photoshop Principal Product Manager John Nack on Tuesday published Adobe's FAQ about its Creative Suite support for Snow Leopard, aka Mac OS X 10.6, that said the current CS4 version from October 2008 is the only one that's supported. The comments quickly took on panicky and angry tones among people who thought their older CS3 version of the software wouldn't work on the new operating system, so Nack followed up on Wednesday with a new post to clarify that CS3 would work, albeit with some caveats.

""To the best of our knowledge, PS CS3 works fine on Snow Leopard,"" Nack said. ""We have reason to expect that all meaningful issues of running Photoshop CS3 under Snow Leopard have been resolved. However, because we have not done the level of testing that true certification demands, we need to stand by our statement that we don't officially support CS3 on Snow Leopard.""

This is the statement in the FAQ that got people riled up:

Q. Will older versions of Adobe creative software--such as Adobe Creative Suite 3 or Macromedia® Studio 8 Software--support Mac OS X Snow Leopard (v10.6)? A. Older versions of Adobe creative software were not included in our testing efforts. While older Adobe and Macromedia applications may install and run on Mac OS X Snow Leopard (v10.6), they were designed, tested, and released to the public several years before this new operating system became available. You may therefore experience a variety of installation, stability, and reliability issues for which there is no resolution. Older versions of our creative software will not be updated to support Mac OS X Snow Leopard (v10.6).

Wrote one commenter, ""I understand that you don't want to waste resources, but I plan on upgrading to Snow Leopard, but cannot afford a new version of CS. At this point, I will not be out growing this version for some time. PLEASE don't leave thousands of us weekend warriors behind with version after version. True, the new tools are cool for the power users, but average folk just can't keep up on price!!! HELP - please support CS3 for a little while longer!!!""

And another: ""The lack of CS3 testing is very disturbing. It was one thing for Adobe not to release CS4 in 64 bit for the Mac. I understand that recompiling the program in a different language is a major undertaking. OK, I can wait for CS5. But now, in what can only be interpreted as an attempt to force an upgrade to a program that doesn't even take advantage of the 64-bit programming in Snow Leopard, Adobe will not even test CS3 for Snow Leopard compatibility.""

Nack denied that particular idea.

""This isn't some kind of ploy to force people to upgrade; rather, it's a recognition that resources are not infinite, and we need to focus our efforts on current and future technology,"" he said.

The upgrade from to Photoshop CS4 costs about $190; various Creative Suite collections that include other Adobe software packages such as Flash Professional, Illustrator, and Dreamweaver cost more.",html

Peter Swire, an Ohio State law professor and privacy expert who has worked with the Obama administration, is stepping into a contentious process to create a standard way to let people stop Web sites from tracking their online behavior.

Aleecia M. McDonald announced today she's stepping down as co-chair of the Do Not Track standardization effort at the World Wide Web Consortium. She previously worked for Firefox maker Mozilla, which launched the current DNT technology after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sought a mechanism to block online tracking, but she currently works for a program within Stanford University's law school.

""Stanford's Center for Internet and Society has had endless patience with DNT taking time far in excess of what I anticipated,"" McDonald said in a mailing list post announcing Swire that is replacing her. The other co-chair remains Matthias Schunter, an Intel employee.

The Wall Street Journal reported the change today, characterizing Swire's involvement as an attempt to salvage the DNT process.

The proposal has indeed been very contentious, with advertisers and privacy advocates rarely seeing the issue eye to eye in the W3C's Tracking Protection Working Group. One major issue is whether DNT should be enabled by default in browsers.

Mozilla sees Swire's appointment as constructive.

""Peter Swire brings considerable expertise and insight in law, technology and policy to this new role as co-chair of the W3C Tracking Protection Working Group,"" Mozilla Chief Privacy Officer Alex Fowler said in a statement. ""I've seen how Peter works over the years and have always been impressed with his ability to bring stakeholders together, break through political quagmires, and move forward in a balanced manner.""

Swire has monitored DNT closely and testified before the U.S. Senate about DNT in June.

In that testimony, Swire took issue with the Digital Advertising Alliance request for an exception to DNT restrictions ""for market research or product development."" Swire testified:

These exceptions are so open-ended that I have not been able to discern any limits on collection under them. Market research includes ""research about consumers."" That would seem to include keeping track of every click made by a consumer. Market research also includes analysis of ""consumer preferences and behaviors."" Again, if I were an FTC enforcer, I don't know what lies outside the scope of the exception. The definition of product development is similarly broad. It includes analysis of ""the characteristics of a market or group of consumers."" To analyze a ""group of consumers"" would seemingly permit collecting each click made by those consumers. Similarly, product development includes analysis of ""the performance of a product, service, or feature.""

Swire also said calls for industry self-regulation are only effective when a real threat of governmental regulation motivates meaningful change. And he concluded with a pro-privacy statement.

""I personally would not like to have an Internet where I believed that each moment of my browsing might easily be breached and shown to the entire world,"" he told the Senate. ""For you and your families, it would reduce the quality of the Internet if you thought that any page you visited needed to be treated like something that might be released to the public.""

Regarding the issue of default DNT settings, Mozilla and Google follow the original standard drafted by Adobe Systems' Roy Fielding of leaving DNT disabled unless a person explicitly turns on the tracking protection. But Microsoft, saying it thinks a stronger privacy stance is required, enables DNT by default in IE10 on Windows 8 if a person accepts the default settings Microsoft suggests. Advertising industry representatives, however, say they'll ignore DNT preferences altogether if it's enabled by default.

Fielding, a founder of the Apache Web server project, wrote a patch that ignores IE10's DNT setting. Yahoo will also ignore IE10's DNT setting, the company said in October. But Paul Cotton, leader of Microsoft's Web standards work, said in an interview he believes Microsoft's DNT stance is the right one.

If advertisers don't budge, there's the prospect they'd have to submit to regulation or a law requiring them to do something. But the FTC stopped short of regulation before, and some in Congress have come to advertisers' defense.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation said Swire oversees the matter of DNT compliance and Schunter oversees the technical functioning of the DNT specification itself.

""We look forward to working with Swire on hammering out powerful standards for protecting online privacy,"" the EFF said in a statement.

There has been a pre-alpha release available since late December, but it hasn't received the multiple public upgrades that the Windows one had, until now.

Opera 10.50 beta 1 contains a lot of Mac-specific changes, most notably the Carakan JavaScript engine which has been noted in the Windows version for making Opera comparable, speed-wise, to Google Chrome.

In casual testing comparing Opera 10.50 beta 1 to Google Chrome 5.0.335.0 on a Mac Mini with OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, a 1.83 Ghz Core 2 Duo processor, and 1 GB of RAM, the development version of Google Chrome was slightly faster than the new Opera beta. Opera scored an average of 598.33 milliseconds over three runs, while Chrome notched 562.53 ms averaged over three runs. Regardless of which one is actually faster, these improvements are just as dramatic as the ones made to the new Opera beta on Windows and indicate the Opera is taking progress seriously on both Windows and Macs.

Other changes include the browser being built from the ground up in Cocoa, Growl and multitouch support, support for the HTML5 < video > tag, and extensive hooks between Opera Widgets and the desktop. This means that widgets can be used as standalone apps, previously limited to the Windows version. Opera Unite also works in this beta, and there have been extensive interface tweaks--though nothing as dramatic as the Windows 7 changes. The new beta also supports OS X 10.4 Tiger, although the browser won't work on PowerPC chips for now.

It's simple to use Firefox ""Quick Searches"" in the location bar to eliminate the need for the Search box entirely. By default, Firefox installs with four Quick Search links already in your bookmarks: Google, Wikipedia, Dictionary.com, and Urban Dictionary.

Try it out. Type ""wp pee-wee herman"" into your regular address bar, hit Enter, and you'll be taken to a special search page on Wikipedia for ""Pee-wee Herman"" that will automatically direct you to the Wikipedia page for Paul Reubens, with no Search box necessary.

The real trick to killing your Search box is transforming all of your installed engines into Firefox Quick Searches. There are several ways to accomplish the feat, but I'll detail the two most common. After that, removing the actual Search box is a snap.

First method

The first technique for changing all of your search engines into Quick Searches is the most reliable, but it takes a bit more effort than the second. Start out by visiting the Web site of the first search engine on your list. Let's use the ubiquitous Internet Movie Database Engine (IMDB) as an example.

On the IMDB home page, find the Search box, and use the drop-down menu next to it to set the type of search you want (titles, names, characters, or ""all""). Then right-click in the empty search field and select ""Add a keyword for this search"" from the context menu. An ""Add bookmark"" dialog will appear. Name your Quick Search (e.g. ""IMDB search"") and select your keyword.

I prefer the shortest keywords possible that are easy enough to remember, so I use ""im"" for IMDB. Decide where you want to save your new search bookmark, and hit ""OK.""

From this point on, in order to search IMDB, you'll only need to type in ""IM "" into your location bar. Give it a try.

Process all of your search engines in this same fashion, creating Quick Searches for each. When you're done, you can kiss that Search box good-bye.

Second method

The second technique for converting search engines into Quick Searches accomplishes the same goal as the first, but it utilizes that pesky Search box while you've still got it around.

First, select Bookmarks -> Organize Bookmarks to open your bookmarks directory. Then go back to your open Firefox browser window. It's easiest to sit those two windows side by side.

Start with the first search engine in your Search box. For me, it's CNET Download.com. Type in ""s"" as your search term, and you'll be taken to this Download.com search result for ""s."" The URL in the address bar looks like this:

http://www.download.com/3120-20_4-0.html?tag=srch&qt=s

You see that ""qt=s"" in the URL? That's your search string. In order to change it to a quick search, all you need to do is change the search term to ""%s"". If you're searching for ""s"" already, all you have to do is add a percentage sign before it. The Quick Search URL will look like this:

http://www.download.com/3120-20_4-0.html?tag=srch&qt=%s

Copy that URL and go back to your Bookmarks window. Select any of the bookmarks in the Quick Searches folder, and hit ""New Bookmark."" In the ensuing dialog window, add the name of the search (""Download.com search""); the ""Location,"" which is the URL above (http://www.download.com/3120-20_4-0.html?tag=srch&qt=%s); the keyword you want to use (I chose ""dl""); and any optional description. Then hit ""OK."" You've now got a new Quick Search for Download.com

Simply repeat the process for each engine in your Search box until you create a Quick Search for all of them

Removing the Firefox Search box

(Credit: Mozilla Firefox)

Now here's the easiest part of the whole process. The Search box can be removed like any other element in your Firefox toolbar. Right-click on any open space in your toolbar, and select ""Customize"" from the context menu. A Customize Toolbar dialog will then appear.

Simply click on any part of Firefox's Search box (your mouse will transform into a hand icon when hovering over the Search box) and drag it into the Customize Toolbar window. Now you see it; now you don't!

If you've got anything like the default Firefox interface, your location bar will now expand all the way across the toolbar to the right edge of the browser. And if you ever get lost and confused without your Search box, you can always bring it back by opening the Customize Toolbar dialog and dragging the Search box anywhere you'd like on the toolbar.

Sample Quick Search bookmarks

If you're still not quite sure what I'm talking about, you can download this CNET Download.com Searches bookmarks file to view some examples. Once you've saved it locally, open Firefox, then go to Bookmarks -> Organize Bookmarks. From the Organize Bookmarks menu, select File -> Import, select ""Import Bookmarks from File,"" and then browse to the ""download_search_bookmarks.html"" file you saved locally.

Now you'll have a new bookmarks folder named ""CNET Download.com Searches"" at the bottom of your bookmarks that includes these 20 Quick Searches listed here:

Amazon.com - Type ""ama "" to search the shopping site Amazon.com.

Boing Boing - Type ""bb "" to search the pop-culture blog Boing Boing.

Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, the most apparent changes in Firefox 3.6 are improvements made to the TraceMonkey JavaScript rendering engine, making it about 20 percent faster than when it debuted in Firefox 3.5, according to Mozilla. Although this makes it more competitive with Google Chrome, but not faster, there's more to Firefox 3.6 than speed.

Firefox maintains its reputation as the most customizable browser around, introducing default support for the next generation of Themes, called Personas. Users will no longer have to download the Personas add-on to get its on-the-fly skinning power. However, Windows 7 interface support, including tab previews using the Ctrl+Tab hot key, jump lists, and multiple tab previews in Aero Peek will have to wait for another revision. Currently, these can only be activated by changing settings in about:config.

Several notable improvements keep Firefox abreast of current browsing tech. Significant under-the-hood changes include blocking third-party software from encroaching on Firefox's file system turf to increase stability; support for the Web Open Font Format, which means users viewing pages in other languages should see faster load times via downloadable fonts; and support for the File interface, which can help with tasks such as uploading multiple photos and is part of the draft HTML5-standard effort. Open, native video can be displayed full screen and supports poster frames, which is the preview image you see before a video begins, and the new CSS attributes gradients, background sizing, and pointer events will work in Firefox 3.6.

HTML5 support debuted in Firefox 3.5, and Firefox remains the leading Web browser that supports it. This is not insignificant, because even with Google Chrome grabbing more than 4 percent of the browser market in its first 16 months, Firefox maintains a commanding 24 percent that hasn't stopped growing, second only to Internet Explorer.

A deeper change to the browser is that it is now running scripts asynchronously, which can help to load a Web page faster by putting off some work until the high-priority chores are complete. Firefox 3.6 also isolates out-of-date plug-ins so they do not become a security risk.

Unlike Firefox 3.5, which was more about keeping the browser current rather than blazing new trails, Firefox 3.6 is once again taking some small but innovative steps. Expect more new features to debut in minor-point updates as the browser works towards Firefox 3.7.",html

There is still plenty to watch on Netflix while you await season 2 of Stranger Things. If you need help zeroing in on a show or movie, there are hundreds of hidden categories that let you search not just for Dramas, for example, but Crime Dramas or Tearjerkers or Dramas based on real life.

The thing is, Netflix keeps these subgenres hidden. Netflix displays about two dozen categories when you mouse over the Browse menu option at the top of its main page, but there are hundreds upon hundreds of subgenre categories you can access manually or via a Chrome extension to narrow your search.

Search codes manually

Thanks to an industrious individual over at What's On Netflix, you can check out these subgenres and their corresponding codes. To browse by one of these secret genre categories, use this URL:

http://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/INSERTNUMBER

and replace INSERTNUMBER with the code of the genre you want to browse.

These codes are useful if you are in the mood for Slasher and Serial Killer Movies (8646) or Screwball Comedies (9702) or something in between. They can also be useful if you are a fan of foreign cinema and want to browse by country; there are many country listings for Foreign Movies.

Search by Chrome extension

With the Netflix Categories extension for Chrome, you can browse many but not all of Netflix's hidden categories. The extension adds a button to the right of Chrome's URL bar. Click on the button to access menu of dozens of the hidden categories. You can mark categories as favorites, which places them up front, above an All Categories button, behind which the other categories are listed. The developer says more categories will be added soon.

TweetDeck TweetDeck is the best Twitter client in this roundup. The Adobe AIR app is designed well and allows you to see your Twitter stream, replies, and direct messages. It also makes it easy to send tweets to update your status. Thanks to its URL-shortening tool, you can quickly reduce the size of a link by choosing between Bit.ly, TinyURL, and others. TweetDeck also provides a link to TwitPic so you can tweet pictures. The app even lets you update your Facebook status.

Twhirl Twhirl is another Adobe AIR app designed to provide you with access to your Twitter account. You can update your Twitter stream, view what others are saying, see your replies, and send direct messages. You can even search Twitter Search or TweetScan to see what's going on in the social network. Twhirl alerts you to replies made to your tweets. It also sends you alerts when it receives tweets. Twhirl isn't nearly as beautifully designed as TweetDeck, so keep that in mind when deciding between the services.

Well that was quick.

After just 2 minutes, tickets for Apple's upcoming annual developers conference in San Francisco are gone.

The show took 2 whole hours to sell out last year. Apple caught many developers by surprise last April when it began selling tickets immediately upon announcing the conference at 5:30 a.m. PT. This time around the company gave developers a little more than a day of advance notice. The event will be held June 10-14 at Moscone West Center.

Apple's WWDC, or ""dub-dub"" as it's often referred to casually, is a mecca for Apple's third-party development community, given that it's the only Apple-run developer event of the year. The rest of Apple's product unveilings and software releases take place at press events, and there hasn't been one since the company unveiled the iPad Mini in October.

Apple

The conference, which runs the whole week and costs $1,599 to attend, is made up of developer sessions and labs, and is staffed by some 1,000 of Apple's own engineers. However the main draw for outsiders is the keynote address that kicks it off, where the company has a long history of announcing new products.

Last year the keynote speech was used to debut new notebooks, a price tag for OS X Mountain Lion, and the first preview of iOS 6, which went on to be released to the public three months later. This year, Apple has already said it will show off new versions of iOS and OS X to developers.

Apple is not alone in the growing popularity of its developer events. Google, which hosts its annual Google I/O conference in the same location on May 15, had a sellout of this year's show in less than an hour. It was just 20 minutes the year before, a big surprise given that the 2010 version of the conference took 50 days before tickets were snapped up.",html

We told you about Turntable.fm's new approach to the music service scene back in June. The service is fun, interactive, and has really caught on since.

Today Turntable.fm released its first mobile app. It's built for the iPhone and is available in the App Store [iTunes link]. We are going to show you how to get started with the mobile app. Read on for more.

Before you attempt to use the mobile app, make sure you have access to the Web site. Turntable.fm isn't open to the public quite yet, it still requires that you have a Facebook friend who is a member of Turntable.fm before you are granted access. If you do have access, go ahead and download and install the iOS app.

Screenshot by Jason Cipriani

After you log in to Turntable.fm using your Facebook credentials, you will be shown a list of the available rooms, in order of popularity. You can create a room of your own, search for a room, or enter any room listed all from this initial screen. Tap on the room you would like to join to enter it.



Screenshot by Jason Cipriani

From here, the experience should be similar to that of the Web site. You are in the standard Turntable.fm room, complete with a scrolling info banner, Lame and Awesome buttons, and of course, there are head-bobbing avatars in the crowd.

Tap on the chat bubble in the top navigation bar to be taken into the rooms' chat.

Screenshot by Jason Cipriani

Here you can chat with others in the same room, as you would from the Web site. Along with being able to chat, you can also view and edit your song queue from this screen. Select the Queue button next to the Chat button in the top navigation bar to view your song queue.

Screenshot by Jason Cipriani

You can drag a song up or down to rearrange your playlist, or search for music to add songs to your queue. We tried searching a few common artists and had mixed luck when it came to getting the same results we were accustomed to seeing on the Web site.



Screenshot by Jason Cipriani

Going back to the room view, on the far-right side of the navigation bar there is a share button that allows you to share a link to the room you are currently in with your friends through Facebook, Twitter, and e-mail.

Screenshot by Jason Cipriani

While you are streaming from one room, you can go back to the room list to browse. You will see a volume slider as well as the AirPlay icon (if available) along the bottom of the screen. The room you are currently in will be highlighted as well as have a red x to the left of the name. To stop streaming from that particular room, tap on the x.



You may notice that the plus sign in the top bar has now changed to Room. You will need to stop streaming a room before you can create your own room. Tap on the plus sign to set up your room and begin DJ-ing yourself.

Screenshot by Jason Cipriani

One the Create Room screen you can set the name of the room, the public or private availability, and the number of DJs you want to allow in the room. Once you have set everything, tap Create.

Screenshot by Jason Cipriani

If you have a friend who is in a room, you will see a gold icon with a number indicating the number of friends in that room next to the name of the room.

Noticeably missing from the app is the ability to view your own Turntable.fm profile along with the ability to edit your avatar. It appears that those two tasks will have to be carried out from the Web site for now.

Are you a big Turntable.fm fan? Is this app something you have been waiting for to really get into the service, or is this something that is going to drive your DJ addiction into overload?",html
https://www.cnet.com/products/mac-os-x-10-10-yosemite/,"Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite Release Date, Price and Specs",,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Late 2016 update

Since releasing Mac OS X Yosemite in October 2014, Apple has delivered two new versions of its desktop operating system -- El Capitan in 2015 and Sierra in 2016 -- and changed its nomenclature. Now known as MacOS, the newest variant comes equipped with features inspired by the iOS mobile software or designed to help Macs work better with iOS products, adding further incentive to keep your hardware inside Apple's walled garden, which includes the iPhone, Apple Watch and Mac computers. (Read the full MacOS Sierra review here.)

In November 2016, the company refreshed its lineup of 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros. Considerably slimmer, faster and pricier than its predecessors, the new models feature some innovative flourishes -- most notably, Apple's dynamic Touch Bar. There's also a less expensive 13-inch model without the Touch Bar.

The common theme among the MacOS Sierra release and the new MacBook models is a greater emphasis on usability and productivity, rather than performance per se. Exhibit A: the Touch Bar, a mini display that runs along the top of the keyboard that provides different icons and options for different apps. Sliders, hot keys and function buttons emerge on the fly as needed.

In addition to leveraging the TouchBar, the newest version of Sierra (release 12.10.1), for the first time integrates Apple's voice-enabled assistant, Siri, with the Mac operating system. It provides new ways to share across and synchronize Apple devices, and brings Apple Pay to the desktop. Bottom line: If your hardware can support the new version of MacOS -- here's a list of supported systems -- it's totally worth the free upgrade.

Editors' note, November 22, 2016: The original Apple Mac OS X Yosemite review, first published in October 2014, follows.

With its latest operating system, Apple is making all of its devices work more closely together, adding continuity features via iOS 8.1 that let you ""handoff"" a project or phone call from one device to the next. But it's also adding tons of refinements to streamline your everyday computing with a more rich Notifications center and Spotlight searches that access information on the Web. Along with the major feature refinements, a new flatter interface design emerges that takes lessons from iOS 7, but manages to remain a unique experience for desktops and laptops.

What results from this mix of new features and reworked design aesthetics is a free Mac OS upgrade that's more useful than previous versions with a modern feel that makes it the best Mac OS yet.

Now available at the Mac App Store for free, Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite was first announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June, and is the second update to be named after a place in Apple's home state of California, after last year's Mavericks.

New design

Yosemite's new design is the first thing you notice booting up for the first time. It's big on translucence and making search front and center. The windows and navigational elements, like the side bar, get translucent and dark, which gives the OS some edge. All of the icons are much flatter, moving the Mac OS X design scheme to be more inline with iOS 7. But don't assume it's a direct copy. Instead, it has a similar feel, but is clearly made for Macs, differentiating itself from other Apple devices.

Virtually every app, from the Menu bar to messages, showcases this slick new design. Calendar, for example, gets a new look for the week view, as well as new details in a view of the day's events at a glance. Safari gets a smaller translucent menubar that keeps all the functionality of Safari in Mavericks, letting you experience more of the Web content you're looking at. Even the Menu bar and system fonts have been replaced to give Yosemite a cleaner, more elegant feel.

Screenshot by Jason Parker/CNET

Full screen apps get a very sensible upgrade in Yosemite, making the ""stoplight"" buttons work more efficiently. The red button still closes a window, and the yellow still minimizes it to the Dock. But the green button now toggles between full-screen apps and standard windows, making it a lot more logical than Mavericks that had the full-screen button in another area on the upper right.

In other words, the design changes are neither revolutionary nor are they a major shift like we had from iOS 6 to iOS 7, but the changes make Yosemite feel more modern, and its cleaned-up elements and new features help to streamline your workflow.

Notifications and widgets

The new Notification Center in Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite should be a lot more useful than before with the additions of both Today view and widgets.

It's true that Mac OS X Mavericks already had a notification center, with a slide-out window from the right you could access with a two-finger swipe on your trackpad or by clicking a button in the upper right. In Yosemite, you'll have the same functionality with all the usual updates, with the addition of the new Today view and widgets from Apple's core apps (and increasingly from third-party software as the OS matures), you'll have more information at your fingertips.

Screenshot by Jason Parker/CNET

The Today view connects with your calendar, social networks, reminders, and more to give you a quick overview of your day. You can see meetings and appointments, any reminders you've set up in the Reminders app, the current weather in your location, and today's birthdays so you know who to send a message to. It's all done with a clean design that divides up each category sensibly so it's easy to read at a glance.

What makes the sidebar notification center even more useful is the addition of widgets. Formerly relegated to the Dashboard, you'll now be able to add core Apple widgets such as your calendar, weather, stocks, world clocks, social networks, a calculator, and reminders so you can interact with them directly without leaving the notification center.

All of these come included with Yosemite at launch. But there will also be several third-party developers adding their own widgets to the mix so you can quickly check out sports scores from ESPN, or get the latest CNN headlines customized to stories you care about.

Spotlight expands to the Web

Just as you clicked the magnifying glass in the upper right (or Command-spacebar) to search your hard drive in Mavericks, Spotlight in Yosemite uses the same controls to deliver local results on your hard drive, and now also finds relevant results from the Web.

Screenshot by Jason Parker/CNET

As an example, searching for ""Golden Gate Bridge"" in Mavericks returns results in the upper right part of the screen from my connected email account and any other files or apps with that name on my hard drive. At the bottom of the search box there are options to search the Web or Wikipedia for Golden Gate Bridge, which opens Safari to load the results. Obviously performing a spotlight search for Golden Gate Bridge in Mavericks is not ideal because it only searches the hard drive, but it illustrates why Yosemite is so much more convenient.

In Yosemite, searching for Golden Gate Bridge gives you location-based results in Maps, news stories about the bridge, the associated Wikipedia entry, and any references to the bridge in your connected email accounts. A similar search on Google will get you much of the same information, but I have to admit it's pretty easy to hit command-spacebar and type in a location for a quick list of results.

What's more, when searching for a restaurant, Spotlight will display a map, address and phone number, plus you'll be able to use Yosemite's Handoff to call the number straight from your Mac.

Watch a quick video to see Spotlight in action

Continuity features and Handoff

Continuity features let you start work on one device then ""handoff"" to another and it lets you make calls directly from your Mac.

With handoff, you can start writing an email on your iPad and then switch over to your Mac. Your Mac automatically knows you were writing the email on a nearby device, and displays a notification in the lower left hand corner that lets you open the email straight away and continue writing from where you left off. Similarly, you could be working on a chart in Numbers on your Mac, then switch to your iPad, pull up from the notification in the lower left of the screen, and continue working on the chart on your iPad.

Screenshot by Jason Parker/CNET

As I mentioned above, Continuity extends to your iPhone's calls and messages as well. When you receive a phone call on your iPhone, you'll be able to get caller ID and answer the call on your Mac as long as both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network. Once you're on a call and another call comes, you'll get a notification about the new call, along with an option to put your current call on hold to answer it; hang up and answer the new call; or add the person to a conference call with you on the other call.

Google users will recall you can do the same thing with Google Voice. Apple makes dialing and answering calls ubiquitous for all Yosemite users -- even from a Web page.

All of this happens using bluetooth and the same Wifi connection. But in my testing, I was pleasantly surprised by the features for call-waiting and conference calls, and can definitely see how this will be useful for just about anyone.

Watch a video that demonstrates Continuity features

Safari gets out of your way

As I mentioned earlier, new design elements across Yosemite attempt to put content first, and Safari is one of the best examples. The new toolbar at the top is much slimmer, but manages to keep all the tools you're used to from Mavericks. It also has the translucence found across all the Yosemite apps showing more of what's behind the tools giving you a better browsing experience.

Navigating Safari is easier too, letting you view all your tabs in stacks with Tab View and making it easier to find the site you want quickly. When you click in the search bar, all your favorite sites show up as icons just below so you can click immediately to go to sites you frequent.

Screenshot by Jason Parker/CNET

Safari also finally gets a private browsing mode and you can isolate one tab for security. When you use a private browsing tab, your history isn't saved, your tabs aren't automatically passed over to other devices and all the data and associated cookies are deleted whenever you close that tab.

As another security precaution, Apple has made clearing your history much easier. When you clear your history, you'll have the option to erase just the last hour or the day to make sure, for example, that your wife's birthday present won't be easily searchable when you walk away from your computer.

Messages grows up

Apple's chat client got a few upgrades too. You'll now be able to carry on group conversations with several people and you can add a title to the conversation so it's easy to remember and find later.

You'll also be able to add more people on the fly without starting a new conversation. A details button in the upper right shows current people connected, and you can click Add Contact to add someone to your chat right away.

Perhaps the best thing about the new conversation tools is you can duck out of a conversation when the group gets a little too feisty. If you're suddenly busy and don't want all the notifications, you can go to the details and check a Do Not Disturb box. To leave the conversation entirely, you can touch a button at the bottom and check out immediately.

Another feature in Messages that's also true for iOS 8, is the ability to view all the attachments for a conversation. Instead of scrolling through the whole conversation to find a picture, for example, you can click the details button and scroll down to see all the images from that conversation in one place.

Messages also lets you add quick sound files when you truly want to laugh out loud and screen sharing for when you want to collaborate.

iCloud Drive and AirDrop

Apple's new updates prioritize cloud sharing and ease of use. There are changes to iCloud Drive that clean up pre-existing iCloud synchronization, adding in support for iOS, as well as Windows, surprisingly.

What Apple has done here is make iCloud Drive behave more like other cloud services, such as Dropbox and Google Drive. Instead of just being able to share iOS and Mac documents, as iCloud did before, you'll now be able to save and access any file from iCloud Drive, regardless of platform.

Another new sharing feature has nothing to do with iCloud Drive, but is excellent alternative for moving files. With Yosemite, AirDrop will now work between iOS and a Mac...finally! You'll be able to share a file from an iPhone to someone nearby on a Mac, by simply dragging and dropping the file to the Mac user's icon, as well as in the opposite direction.

Mail Markup and sending big files

The Mail app has needed an upgrade for a long time, and Yosemite adds some features which move it in a better direction. Not only can you send encrypted messages in the native app, you can also mark up your emails, annotate images, comment, and add speech bubbles. It's clip-art meets email.

Screenshot by Jason Parker/CNET

Even more exciting is the ability to send attachments up to 5GB in size to friends whose email clients can't normally accept them. Mail Drop fixes this with a drag and a drop, transferring your attachments to the cloud. From there your recipient can download up to 5GB in attachments, where most email clients limit attachment sizes on their own. What about friends who use a different client? No problem -- they can grab the files from iCloud Drive through a download link that's sent with the email.

Watch a video to see how Mail Markup works

iCloud Drive

With iCloud Drive Apple is changing it's cloud service to one that's more like standalone clients like Dropbox or Google Drive. With iCloud Drive you can now store any type of file (not just Apple app-made files) and even Windows users can take advantage of the free service.

Whatever the file is, you can put it in your iCloud Drive folder (accessed in favorites area of the Finder sidebar) and be able to access it from any of your devices. You'll be able to access and work with all your files even when you're offline, and once your Mac finds a connection, your files will be automatically synced back up.

Windows users will need to download iCloud for Windows. Once installed, Windows users will be able to access their files through Windows Explorer or they can use any Web browser to access iCloud.com.

Family Sharing

Family Sharing lets a family of up to six people share purchases from iBooks, iTunes, and the App Store without sharing accounts. You can share photos, a family calendar and more across all the devices within your family.

Probably the best feature is the ability for a parent to control what gets purchased on iTunes with a system that asks for permission when someone in the family wants to buy an app, book, or music.

Once a parent has set up Family Sharing, everyone will have access to everyone's iBooks, Apps, and music. The app sets up a shared family photo album where you can share photos and videos and make comments on your favorite memories, and all additions and changes will be synced to each of your family's devices.

You'll also be able to use a shared family calendar so everyone knows the rest of the family's schedule. You also can send out reminders to the family when you want to notify them of important events.

Photos app coming early next year

We got a sneak peek at the Photos app at WWDC in June, but Apple says it won't be available until 2015. The new app will let you share photos across devices. Promised features include improved scrolling, the ability to pinch out to collections and years, and more editing features. You'll be able to share and edit photos across all of your Apple devices thanks to iCloud.

Some complaints remain

I feel like I'm starting to sound like a broken record here, but I still wonder why some apps and features have seen no significant upgrades.

Launchpad is something I talked about when I reviewed Mavericks, because it seems like an iOS design element that's been shoe-horned into a desktop operating system. I can already click the apps folder in the Dock to get a pop-up window of app icons, and frankly I don't see how it's much different than Launchpad. To be fair, Launchpad has it's own search field so you can zero in on the app you want, but I still don't see the need for multiple ways to do the same thing.

The other app which seems to be going stale is Game Center. While I appreciate being able to view my games, friends, and use the platform for connecting to others, there just isn't much of a reason to ever open the app itself. Most games that use Game Center for connecting to others never require you to open the app, using the platform to connect in the background.

I still think Game Center needs something more to make it useful, such as the ability to see what my friends are playing right now, or a way to join up in a co-op situation. As is, I almost never look at the app and think Apple needs to come up with a way that makes it a fun and necessary tool for gamers.

Conclusion

Mac OS X Yosemite is a free upgrade that isn't going to completely change the way you use your computer, but the design refresh along with tons of refinements make it more than worth the time it takes to download.

What you're getting with this upgrade are more efficient ways of doing things (such as being better able to manage group conversations in Messages), while your desktop and mobile devices get more ways to work together (with Continuity and Handoff).

The launch of Yosemite comes at a time when Microsoft is starting to refine its OS experience with Windows 10. Where Yosemite mostly refines the features you already have, Windows 10 seems to still be trying to get the ""OS anywhere"" concept right. At this early stage, there's not much to talk about with Windows 10 due out sometime in the second half of next year, but from the technical preview we know the Smart Menu will finally make its return in a form that people will appreciate from earlier versions. In other words, Apple continues to push forward making current features better, while Microsoft seems to be correcting past mistakes.

Apple isn't perfect either, of course. There are still a couple of head-scratchers that haven't seen significant upgrades in some time, Launchpad and Game Center. But with so many features to better connect all your Apple devices, a new design that brings OS X into modern times, and several refined features that make common actions easier, Yosemite is still an upgrade you won't want to skip.",html

The cleaning utility can do just about anything you can think of, from deleting browsing tracks to uninstalling programs to cleaning up the assorted file detritus that daily use of your computer creates. What makes this particular program interesting is that, like Soluto, it draws on anonymously contributed data from its users to help keep your system running like a well-oiled machine. Unlike Soluto, SlimCleaner is really for advanced users, people comfortable mucking around in Windows system settings.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Although the collection of tools here is robust, and the scans are surprisingly fast, the crowdsourced utility is what makes SlimCleaner interesting. The program uses an in-house process called ""authoritative ranking"" to evaluate each user's ranking submissions. A user's ranking is rated against that person's previous levels of accuracy, and then weighed against other users who are known to have highly accurate rankings. Evaluations that are too far outside the mean get flagged.

The program is divided into six sections: Cleaner, Optimize, Uninstaller, Shredder, Hijack Log, and Windows Tools. Most people will be concerned with the first four components. The Hijack Log provides an interactive list of running components on your computer. This includes toolbars, services, start-up entries, ActiveX components, drivers, and codecs. The list is useful, but it's a diagnostic tool that only advanced users will be able to parse without assistance.

The Cleaner is also the program's main landing page. The tool is designed to delete data that gets automatically stored on your computer, such as temporary files and browsing tracks, and so the first thing you see is a bulleted list of categories that you can clean. Although the program launches into a list, you can toggle cleaning each one individually via a radio button next to the listing. There are also three categories that can be cleaned: Windows system, Browser, and Applications.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

SlimCleaner has a robust selection of tools, yet there isn't a lot of obvious guidance for newcomers. The phenomenal selection is made up of options that are easy to use if you know what they mean or don't mind looking them up. Unfortunately, most people will find the program obtuse and confusing, and that makes it hard to navigate because it's not readily apparent where you are or what you're doing.

While the Cleaner is for removing tracks, SlimCleaner's Optimize feature is where the Startup and Services managers live. From here, you can toggle which programs and services run on start-up. Conveniently, there's a Restore list as well, so items you disable can easily be re-enabled. This is also where you'll see the community ratings first come into play, as each item has a color-coded community rating and a More Info button. As micromanaging Windows functions can be complicated even for people with experience, the additional resources are an excellent idea.

The Optimize and Uninstaller sections have nearly identical layouts, which makes sense given that their functions are similar. There are two RAM and CPU usage gauges on the top, followed by the list of items to toggle or uninstall, the aforementioned community rating, and more info buttons. There's also a search feature so you can easily sift through long lists.

Like other free file shredders, SlimCleaner's Shredder gives you four levels of file deletion. You can choose from a single overpass for basic deletion, a three-pass option, a seven-pass option, and the Guttman 35-pass level.

All these features combine to make for a robust Windows cleaning utility that just lacks a better layout and more on-the-fly explanations of what some of the options do. While the crowdsourcing aspect is innovative, SlimCleaner faces an uphill battle in getting users to care enough to spend time rating utilities when there are far more interesting things going on in the world.

Then again, maybe what the Windows utility world lacks is an alternate reality game for system tools.",html

Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, The noticeable changes to the release candidate from beta 4 and the b99 pre-release version are not readily apparent. Generally, you can expect the release candidate to be more stable than its beta predecessors, although if you're using an add-on such as Nightly Tester Tools or MR Tech to force incompatible add-ons to work in the beta you may be compromising your stability somewhat.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

The upgrades to Firefox 3.5 have been well-documented by now. Private browsing, geolocation, faster performance than Firefox 3 for both loading pages and running JavaScript, local storage for better offline support, and native video for Ogg/Vorbis. If you're running the release candidate or one of its beta predecessors, you can check out Daily Motion to see how the non-Flash based video playback performs.

More improvements include support for HTML5 tags such as and , native JSON support, support for Web workers so browser-based apps can run in the background, support for CSS and SVG standards, the ability to erase browsing traces by site or by time, personas for easier theme management, and downloadable fonts. The release candidate is also available in more than 70 language localizations.

Because of the 800,000 or so testers that Mozilla says have been using the beta versions, Firefox director Mike Beltzner said that he expects this to be the sole release candidate before version 3.5 goes public at the end of June.

Available exclusively today from Download.com, the first ExploitShield Browser Edition beta (download) appears to stop all manner of exploits, from those affecting browsers directly to browser plug-ins like PDF readers, Flash, and Java, to Microsoft Office components, to a handful of media players. The potential for raising the level of computer security here is huge, as a vast number of threats are actually mutations of malware, sold in kits like BlackHole, exploiting the same security holes in the same security programs.

The Windows-only ExploitShield is freeware for individuals and non-profits, part of ZeroVulnerabilityLabs' attempt to prove that the technology is so important that it's worth giving away. The company is working on a licensed version for businesses, although they don't have a timeline for its release yet.

Software exploits have long been a thorny software problem, hard to prevent because of source code complexity. For some notorious software, such as Java, Flash, and QuickTime, it can sometimes seem as though two exploits crop up for each one that gets patched. A panacea that cures all exploits, even ones that have yet to be used to breach a program, sounds too good to be true. Several Windows security suites have promised to block browser exploits, with Kaspersky's 2013 Automatic Exploit Prevention feature to be among the strongest offered, but that will set you back $60 retail.

In terms of features, ZeroVulnerabilityLabs plans on following in the footsteps of other free security programs that offer a paid upgrade. The free version of ExploitShield includes protection against drive-by downloads only, a powerful protection tool, as well as protection against attacks based on document file formats and media file formats. The company hopes to attracts businesses to the corporate upgrade by offering those features, and protection against DLL memory injection attacks, shield management for network deployment, quarantine management, and a centralized reporting portal.

ExploitShield is Silicon Valley's ZeroVulnerabilityLabs' first release. It's been in development for the past 12 months, according to its two co-founders, both of whom are experienced security researchers. Pedro Bustamante has more than 20 years' experience as a security researcher; the other co-founder is David Sanchez Lavado, a former employee of the security firm S21Sec and Panda Security, and ZeroVulnerabilityLabs' Chief Technical Officer.

""Ninety-five percent of successful exploits are Java- or PDF-based,"" said Bustamante in a meeting at CNET's San Francisco offices last June. ""ExploitShield protects against exploit-delivered malicious payload,"" he said. ""It's vulnerability-agnostic.""

Because of the potentially implications of a freeware exploit-blocker that protects most major software, CNET insisted on permission from ZeroVulnerabilityLabs to hand off ExploitShield to independent experts to evaluate its efficacy.

Jeremiah Grossman, Chief Technical Officer of WhiteHat Security, said in an e-mail to CNET requesting comment on ExploitShield that the software offered a ""concept and value proposition"" that ""sounds pretty good, especially in a corporate environment.""

""There are a ton of important and unanswered questions here, but that's a good thing. This could be a strong emerging player that establishes a niche market. I'll be watching them for sure,"" he said.

Bustamante was reticent to explain how ExploitShield works, but did offer some insight in an e-mail. ""It is not blacklisting, not whitelisting, and not sandboxing. We call it 'application shielding,' and it's basically a pro-active way of preventing vulnerability exploits. It blocks 100 percent of the exploits it protects against, 100 percent of the time. I think it's a new type of security software category, i.e., 'anti-exploits',"" he said.

ZeroVulnerabilityLabs is making some heady claims with ExploitShield that so far appear to be supported by my everyday use of the software. Bustamante said in a subsequent e-mail to CNET that, ""this is not an intrusive security technology like antivirus, whitelisting, or sandboxing. It is completely transparent to the user, install-and-forget.""

Bustamante explained that currently known exploit methods against Microsoft's EMET and 32-bit based ASLR, such as ROP and anti-anti-ROP exploits, are blocked by ExploitShield.

At least on the counts of performance and stability, I have not noticed any appreciable differences in browser behavior. Bustamante did caution, however, that since ExploitShield is in beta, those problems could still crop up.

Adam J. O'Donnell, Chief Architect for the Cloud Technology Group at Sourcefire, said that the community of security experts will be curious about how ExploitShield works. ""Once the thing is put up for download, everyone will be reversing it,"" he wrote to CNET in an e-mail earlier this week, after looking at ExploitShield. He also vouched for Bustamante's reputation, no small matter in the world of computer security.

Grossman agreed that ExploitShield could have far-reaching implications. ""If this works as advertised, [it] sounds like they could have something very special here. The concept and value proposition sounds pretty good, especially in a corporate environment,"" he said.",html

Lookout for iOS (download) brings some mobile-specific security enhancements, such as a System Advisor, Contacts Backup, and Missing Device tools, but it lacks a scan for malicious apps and other traditional app or program-based local threats.

(Credit: Lookout)

This is by design, Kevin Mahaffey, Lookout's chief technology officer, said last week in an interview at the CNET office in San Francisco. ""How do we create a security tool for 95 percent of users? The key problems we've tried to solve are the most prevalent,"" he said.

Those problems include the hydra-headed whopper of educating the public about what security risks can bloom into legitimate threats on iOS, when Apple touts the operating system as being eminently secure and when many of the threats demonstrated exist so far only in proof-of-concept form. This differs from Android, where more of the threats--such as malicious apps designed to steal personal data or wreak havoc on your phone--have snuck into the Android Market.

To that end, Mahaffey said, Lookout's iOS app contains features to address specific, current problems. The Missing Phone service, for example, includes a device locator and a ""scream,"" a high-decibel wail that can be activated remotely to irritate whomever has walked off with your iPhone or iPad. This is a step up from the free Find My Phone app.

More interestingly are some of the features included to address information security. You can back up your contacts and sync them with any Android devices that also have Lookout installed. At the very least, this is a good feature for contact migration.

The System Advisor contains several tools that ought to appeal to a range of people, from beginners to power users. It shows you how to update your phone, definitely for newbies, but also includes upgrade instructions for people with jailbroken phones. Color-coded warnings are used: green means you're safe, while orange signifies that your phone is at risk.

(Credit: Lookout)

There's also basic public Wi-Fi network protection in the form of a pop-up that lets you know you're connected to an insecure network. It also reminds you to look for a Lock icon, indicating that the Web site you're attempting to load resolves through the more secure HTTPS.

Another tool collates the privacy control options and shows you how to change them.

One feature that the Android version of Lookout has that the iOS one doesn't--but is still a legitimate security concern--is some form of Safe Browsing. Safe browsing is most often described as the ability to scan links opened in Safari to prevent phishing attacks. Mahaffey said that it's not included in iOS Lookout because of difficulties hooking into the iOS ecosystem. Apple may like to keep its development circuit closed, but as more people begin using smartphones and making payments with smartphones, the risks will only increase.",html

Internet Explorer 9 (download after 9 p.m. PT) debuts to the public not only as the fastest, most standards-compliant version of IE yet, but also as one that can stand up and compete on features and looks with Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, and the Opera browser. Along with IE's new features, though, Microsoft has a clear message for Windows XP users: hurry up and upgrade to Windows 7 already.

Microsoft's official explanation for why Internet Explorer 9 doesn't support Windows XP, the operating system that runs on an estimated 40 percent to 50 percent of the world's computers, is that the graphics card-powered hardware acceleration that helps the browser load pages faster doesn't work properly with the device drivers on Windows XP. However, at least one other browser, Firefox 4 release candidate 1, offers full hardware acceleration across multiple operating systems, including Windows XP.

The lack of support for Windows XP aside, Internet Explorer 9 is a fantastic browser when compared with its predecessors, and competitive against its toughening rivals. The browser offers some great new features, such as Pinned sites, a revamped search box, and add-on performance impact notifications.

Pinned sites create a tighter integration between the browser and desktop by creating site-specific browsers. Drag a tab onto the Windows 7 desktop taskbar, and depending on the site developer's coding you can get site-specific jump lists, unread e-mail notifications, or streaming media player controls. Other major sites that have Pinned integration include Groupon, CNN, Pandora, Hulu, Slacker, Facebook, Twitter, and eBay.

Meanwhile, the new unified search box manages to include all the functionality of the old search box, such as changing search providers on the fly, while introducing on-the-fly searching so that as you type you see a relevant list of Web results, bookmarks, and browsing history.

The add-on performance notification is a small but useful feature that warns you when an add-on is slowing down the browser. You can customize what level of impact is warned for, too.

The performance of the browser itself has been lauded since last year when Microsoft rolled out developer's previews. Over the course of the following year, the developer's previews, betas, and release candidate version of IE 9 were downloaded more than 25 million times, and amounted to around 2 percent of all installed versions of Internet Explorer on Windows 7 by the time the release candidate was published.

Facebook users with a synced photo album are receiving an email from the social network that says they'll have to install and log in to the company's Moments app by July 7, or else have all their photos inside that album deleted.

The app, released last year, allows for private uploads of photos for sharing with friends without actually putting them onto the social network. Before Moments, Facebook put into its main app a similar feature called Photo Sync, back in 2012, which, when turned on, automatically uploaded photos from a smartphone into a private ""Synced from phone"" album. That album will be going away after July 7, making Moments the way Facebook wants its users to automatically upload photos privately.

It's something of a departure for a site that prides itself on its utilitarian nature--even the addition of graphical smileys to Gmail can be justified as improving a message's emotional nuance. But given Google's move toward the mainstream, it's smart. People like to personalize their frequently-used computing tools.

Perhaps more interesting from a brand perspective, Google is even willing to give up the Gmail logo in some of the skins. That suits me fine--I find the logo an eye-trippingly ugly hodgepodge of the Google G, a graphical envelope for the ""m"", and three sans-serif letters for ""ail.""",html

Under the new guidelines of Comcast's Acceptable Use Policy announced Thursday, that cap will be set at 250 gigabytes per month, per account.

Users who go over the limit will get a courtesy call from Comcast's customer service for the first instance. However, under the new policy a second-time offense means the service is immediately suspended for an entire calendar year.

Surprisingly the company is not providing any tools to help users monitor their current usage. An FAQ on Comcast's support site simply suggests that customers do a ""Web search"" for bandwidth metering software that will track this amount for them. Going forward there may be plans to set up alerts over certain thresholds, or bundle some official tool as part of the company's starter software.

Comcast notes that the median usage for most residential customers falls somewhere between 2GB and 3GB, a number that is regularly broken within a matter of hours and sometimes minutes by customers taking advantage of streaming HD video and online backup services. The company breaks down basic usage numbers similar to what's seen on the marketing materials on a consumer hard drive:

* Send 50 million e-mails (at 0.05KB/e-mail)

* Download 62,500 songs (at 4MB/song)

* Download 125 standard-definition movies (at 2GB/movie)

* Upload 25,000 high-resolution digital photos (at 10MB/photo)

A far greater problem may be the slighting of cloud storage services that offer file transfer and backup. Services like Carbonite and Mozy let you back up and transfer the entirety of your computer's storage several times per month, which on many standard consumer machines can be in the hundreds of gigabytes.

Apple, too, is just at the beginning stages of MobileMe, a service that offers sync and file backup to multiple devices. Additionally, the rumored all-you-can-eat iTunes could drastically change how much downloading users are doing on a monthly basis.

The practice of rifling through address books is at the core of many social apps.

Apps vendors are running fast, trying to build the best social apps they can. Social apps are by nature interconnected, and the best way to build a socially-connected user base is to throw all users' contact books together and see who's connected to whom, to give users the option to match up, in their apps, the connections they already have.

Other vendors have done this, and in fact have been burned by it. Ted Livingston, who launched the Kik instant messaging app in 2010, knows Path's pain. He's been there. His app absorbed address books. Not because Kik had any intention of misusing the information or in breaking users' trust. In fact, Livingston told me, ""We thought it was a cool feature of the app. We didn't think it was a violation of privacy.""

Was he naive? Certainly. He was 22 at the time, running an app that had achieved explosive success: it had 2 million users after 22 days. (This figure has been corrected from the original version of this story.)

Kik revised its contact data-collection procedure fast when a Path-like (but smaller) dust-up arose. ""We got messages from a handful of users who told us we should be asking for permission."" Then it became a painful news item, Livingston said.

Livingston said it took Kik ""just a few days"" to modify the app to be more transparent. Not only did new alerts tell users that their address book would be uploaded, but a secondary confirmation, if you opted out, reminded them that the whole point of the app was to make connections. ""Are you sure?"" the pop-up asks. ""You will have to add each of your friends manually.""

Other companies use hashing or encryption to protect address book privacy. Localmind CEO Lenny Rachitsky, for example (see Localmind gooses location-advice service) told me that ""We hashed all address book data and sent it over SSL."" So not only were users' address books not human-readable on the Localmind servers, but the transmission of the data was encrypted on the way there.

You are not your user

The challenge for developers is to recognize that data that one person doesn't care about may be of life-or-death import to another. That's why being deliberate when it comes to data practices is a good idea. But deliberation slows you down.

And that's why the platform companies, like Apple, Google, and Facebook, have to moderate developers eager to have their app suck up data first, and ask questions later. This has already happened with location data to a much greater extent than it does with address data. And Google, at least, does block Android apps from accessing address books without user permission. Facebook provides social matching as a service to developers who use that social network--so Facebook-reliant apps don't actually get the address books.

Apple has been behind in this. It relied on policy to protect address books. That policy, clearly, has failed. And it failed a long time ago.",html

The next point release of Apple's iOS has been made available to developers along with a pre-release version of the Mac OS X operating system that includes the upcoming AirPrint feature.

iOS 4.2, which replaces version 3.2.2 of Apple's mobile operating system, was announced and demonstrated by Apple at its September music event. It's notable in that it will finally bring multitasking, folders, Game Center, AirPlay, and an overhauled version of the built-in e-mail client to iPad users--all features iPhone and iPod Touch users have had since late June.

This version of 4.2 is likely the first of several betas that will be seeded to developers ahead of a public release. At its music event, Apple announced that 4.2 would be made available as a free software update in November, leaving the next two months for bugs to get squashed.",html

SAN FRANCISCO--For a short time Monday morning the demo gods were not smiling on Steve Jobs.

About 40 minutes into the Apple CEO's keynote speech in which he was introducing his company's latest gadget, the iPhone 4, his demo came to an abrupt halt. He was attempting to show the difference in how Web site text was displayed between the new retina display feature on the iPhone 4 versus the iPhone 3GS, but the conference hall Wi-Fi set up at Moscone West was not cooperating. Only one of the phone's browser windows was loading. The other was blank except for the half-filled blue progress bar along the top.

Jobs fiddled with the phone for a few seconds in silence. ""Well geez. I guess I can't show you that much today,"" he said reluctantly. ""I can show you some pictures."" So he moved on to that. He tried to come back to the demo of the phone's browser, but no luck.

Now Playing: Watch this: Steve Jobs demo fail

""I'm sorry guys, I don't know what's going on,"" he said to the crowd of developers and media. ""Got any suggestions?"" he asked. Someone from the back helpfully shouted, ""Verizon!"" Though the crowd laughed, Jobs took it in stride. He said simply, ""We're actually on Wi-Fi here.""

It was an embarrassing and rare moment for Apple, and for Jobs, whose keynotes are known for being perfectly choreographed from beginning to end. He did, however, by the end have a solution.

About 20 minutes later, Jobs said he'd figured out that there were more than 570 Wi-Fi connections in the room that were disrupting his demo.

""So you guys have a choice: Either turn off your Wi-Fi (devices) or I give up. Would you like to see the demos?"" he asked the crowd. ""Then all you bloggers need to turn off your notebooks. Go ahead, just shut the lids. I'll wait,"" he said.

A few people in the media section did appear to be complying. We at CNET use our trusty Sprint 3G cards, so we weren't at fault for the Wi-Fi fail. However, that didn't stop an Apple public relations representative from telling us to turn off our computers. We politely declined.

But Jobs shouldn't feel that bad. The same thing happened at Google I/O two weeks ago in the same Moscone West conference room: Google had to ask attendees to turn off their cell phones, as the interference with Bluetooth signals onstage had brought their demo to a standstill.

But Apple doesn't usually let stuff like that happen more than once. Here's betting that's the last time Apple has free public Wi-Fi at one of their events.",html

9. 1916 - Der unbekannte Krieg (PC, Mac)

The Download.com directory is chock full of World War II games, but rarely do we get one set in the First World War, not to mention one with a horror element to it. In the midst of the Great War, you play a young German soldier as he navigates the trenches. With bodies of fallen comrades lying all around and shells constantly dropping, surviving the trenches is no easy task...then the pack of dinosaurs arrives. Your objective is to make your way through the trenches while avoiding bombardments, mustard gas, and velociraptors (no joke) to find the exit ladder.

1916 is not the average war game. The music and visual styles are impressive for an indie game -- overall, it does a terrific job creating a gruesome atmosphere. Our German-speaking readers will enjoy an even higher level of immersion as everything in 1916 is in German. The dinosaurs add an surreal element but that's a good thing. The true horror is that there isn't an English version yet.

8. Dark Ocean

Disappointed fans of the Resident Evil series who didn't get their scare fix in Six might find some consolation in Dark Ocean. The action takes place aboard an ocean liner where something has gone horribly wrong. ( SPOILER ALERT: Everyone on the ship has been turned into zombies! ) You play a young woman, a lone survivor who must find a way to escape the nightmare and solve the mystery of the infection. (Why not, right?) It's not like she has better things to do, like keep on living.

You navigate your way through the liner armed only with trusty flare guns and a flash camera. The camera flash can temporarily stun undead assailants, but it must recharge. Your flare gun can set them ablaze but ammo is limited. Years of survivor horror have prepared us for all sorts of Zombies Apocalypse scenarios, so we found Dark Ocean not too scary, but there's a decent amount of shock factor to make up for it. You might notice a sly nod to older games in the action-horror genre in one familiar scene. Final verdict: not too shambling for indie zombies, but not the scary sprinting zombies either.

At first glance, Hide appears to be a simple scavenger hunt. Underestimate Hide and you could be in for a nasty surprise. Beneath its 8-bit texture, Hide is an amazing thriller game. It continuously builds suspense without allowing the player a moment's rest using simple visuals and well-timed sound effects.

The task is simple. Collect five pieces of paper with less than cheery writings on them -- all done while trudging through a snowy forest with air-raid siren blaring that would bring tears to any Silent Hill's fan. Also be sure to hide (name drop!) from the mysterious figures tracking you through the woods. Hide is one of those times when it's not a good idea to go toward the lights.

6. Erie

Not too often do we see professional quality games as freeware on Download.com. Thanks to the distributing platform Desura and the University of Utah, you can play Erie for no charge. In the first-person action game, you are Oliver Victor, a Red Cross Investigator sent to find locals who have been slowly disappearing after their neighborhood nuclear generator had a slight meltdown. Upon arrival, Oliver realized that his rescue mission has quickly turned into a race for survival.

Beyond the outlandish setup (why didn't Oliver call the police or why did he waltz into a nuclear power plant in the middle of a meltdown...without a radiation suit), Erie's creators know a thing or two about scaring their players. The graphic and sound are a cut above the other games on this list. The Unreal Engine has been twisted and manipulated to give players a convincing scare. If visuals are high on your list, Erie is definitely (dare we say it) eerie enough to check out.

As iPhone 5 rumors have trickled over the past month, one that's popped up repeatedly is a screen so big it nearly does away with the bezel. That's the area around the display, and right before the very edge of the device that sits as unused space.

But such a screen might be at odds with a new Apple patent application unearthed by Patently Apple. The patent outlines a secondary display embedded within the bezel that would extend what's happening on the main screen to the surrounding area.

The applications for such a design are broad, from notifications and other indicators to a display area that apps can make use of to extend the user interface. Such features could be handy on a small screen where even given a high-pixel density, total real estate is limited by the casing itself.

The patent description spells this much out:

To assist a user in providing inputs, traditional devices use the display to provide indicators to the user regarding where and how to provide a touch input. For example, a traditional device may display a virtual button on a touch screen to indicate that a user can touch that portion of the screen to provide an input. However, providing such indicators occupies space on the touch screen that could otherwise be used for displaying visual content.

The patent describes this functionality including not just phones, but media players like the iPod, PDAs, laptops, and cameras.

To add to this, the patent says the touch-sensitive area could spill onto this secondary display, effectively opening the device up to a broader array of gestures and types of interactions. The impact on gaming alone could be especially big, with games that make use of onscreen controls choosing to instead go with an off-screen touch pad.

As Patently Apple notes, this is not the first such Apple patent to discuss bringing touch controls to off-screen areas of gadgetry. One in 2006 detailed one for iPods that would use the surrounding area to map playback controls depending on the application in use. This was months ahead of the release of the iPod Touch, which would negate the need for this by making use of a touch screen instead.

More recently, two patents that were actually granted early last year (unlike the one in this story, which remains a pending application), included a bezel that could be set up to control functions such as volume, screen brightness, and navigation.

Another patent depicted adding touch sensitivity to the back of a tablet (such as the iPad) to give users an extra, off-screen area for controlling what was happening onscreen.

As with all other patent-related posts, it's worth taking these illustrations and ideas with a grain of salt, as they are not guaranteed to become a part of shipping products. Nonetheless, many have, which can make them fascinating.",html

REDMOND, Wash.--Microsoft kicked off its Professional Developers Conference today, releasing an updated test version of Internet Explorer 9, the company's effort to reassert itself in the Web browser market.

""We've tried to make the Web feel more like native applications,"" CEO Steve Ballmer said as part of a keynote speech this morning.

The update is a new platform preview that developers can use to test Web sites, but is not an update to the more full-featured beta version that Microsoft released earlier this year. Microsoft had said it would continue to update the platform preview versions for developers even after releasing the beta. Unlike the beta, the platform preview can be used alongside earlier versions of the browser. Microsoft said there won't be a second beta of IE9, but there will be a near-final ""release candidate"" before the final version is released.

Ballmer also talked about coming improvements to Windows Azure and noted that it expects to have more than 1,000 apps for Windows Phone when the devices go on sale November 8.

""We're driving hard,"" Ballmer told a crowd at the Microsoft conference center here. Although he talked about Windows 7, phones, and the browser, Ballmer stressed the role the cloud is playing in all areas of computing. ""The cloud is a backplane on which to program and rapidly deploy applications. These are powerful new platforms.""

Josh Lowensohn/CNET

Ballmer said that HTML 5 is the glue that will allow all kinds of new programs and devices to emerge.

Microsoft changed the format of its conference this year, having fewer people at the conference itself, but broadcasting it on the Web and having 30,000 people at local events worldwide.

Ballmer also took a moment to tout Microsoft's consumer efforts, touting Windows 7 PC sales, the release of Windows Phone, as well as the gesture-recognizing Kinect add-on for the Xbox 360.

""It is really remarkable,"" he said.

As for the phone, Ballmer said, ""I think we really kind of nailed it,"" noting that it is more personal, offering more options than a one-size-fits-all approach (i.e. Apple) while offering more coherence (clearly a knock on Android).

Microsoft showed several Windows Phone apps including Facebook, a TurboTax title from Intuit, and, for the first time, the Kindle app for Windows Phone 7.

Ballmer also excited the crowd by telling the developers in attendance that each of them would be getting a free Windows Phone. Paid attendees will also get a free registration for the Windows Phone marketplace and Ballmer urged them to write some cool programs for their phone.

""We need your best work,"" he intoned, promising that in return Microsoft is going to put its full marketing muscle behind the new phone operating system.

Ballmer also showed the crowd some of the advertising for Windows Phone 7--ads that depict the phone as easy to access at a glance, contrasting humorously with current smartphones which often have users with their heads buried in their device as life passes them by. ""Man, are we going to pump and thump,"" Ballmer said of the company's ad push for the new phones. ""You're going to see a lot of these ads.""

On the PC front, Ballmer said, as he has frequently, that Windows 7 machines will take new shapes and forms in the coming year, but didn't announce any new efforts on that front. The company has been under pressure to offer up a competitive response to Apple's iPad.

Josh Lowensohn/CNET

""You'll see people push,"" he said, noting ink (the ability to write onscreen using a stylus) and touch is built into Windows 7.

Ballmer gave way to server and tools boss Bob Muglia, who talked about Microsoft's effort to move from selling server software to offering tools and services for a world in which businesses can move more of their efforts to the cloud.

Muglia noted that, while it is a major shift, the move offers the ability to shift work from IT managers who today spend much of their time dealing with patches, updates, and other maintenance work.

""You are dealing with a lot of changes that aren't helping you,"" Muglia said. ""That is all a lot of work,"" he said.

Windows Azure, Muglia said, allows businesses to offload much of that work. Even other virtualization options, he said, require hands-on work from businesses. ""With today's world there is a lot of assembly required.""

Microsoft announced some new options for Azure, including a lower-priced tier of the service as well as enhanced capabilities for moving existing virtual machines and applications onto the cloud-based operating system. The company also plans to add the ability to create virtual machines on Azure.

The goal, Muglia said, is to give businesses more time to spend on the applications that benefit the bottom line. To highlight the point, Muglia brought Disney's Pixar on stage to talk about how Azure will allow smaller moviemakers that can't afford their own huge data center farm the ability to use high-end rendering software.

Pixar's Chris Ford said the company has moved its RenderMan rendering software--an application that runs on Windows, Mac and Linux--to Windows Azure, which allows smaller studios to tap into the cloud only when they need server capacity.

In addition, Microsoft announced it has finalized a new marketplace for Windows Azure including a way to get data feeds, known as DataMarket. Formerly known by its ""Dallas"" code name, DataMarket allows companies to sell or make available for free various feeds that application makers can include in their programs.",html

""Performance is a huge, huge, huge thing for us,"" said Mike Beltzner, vice president of engineering for Firefox, in a Webcast on Tuesday about plans for the browser. ""We created the performance story, and we've got to keep at it.""

Among other features planned for Firefox 4--and Mozilla emphatically cautions that plans can change--are support for high-speed graphics and text through Direct2D on Windows; a tidier user interface with more prominent and powerful tabs; support for several newer Web technologies; 64-bit versions; and compatibility with multitouch interfaces.

Performance means any number of things in a browser. Among them: the time it takes to launch the program or to load a Web page, the responsiveness of the user interface to commands such as opening new tabs, and the speed with which Web-based JavaScript programs execute. Firefox programmers also will work on more perceptual speed improvements, Beltzner said, such as changing the order that Web page elements appear on the screen and the appearance of the page-loading progress bar.

Mozilla

Speed is one item on a long list of changes Mozilla has in mind for its 5-year-old open-source Firefox browser. Improving Firefox is arguably a greater challenge now, though, for several reasons.

First, there's new energy in competitors including Microsoft's Internet Explorer 9 and Chrome from Web powerhouse Google. Second, making abrupt changes is harder without ruffling feathers among its large user base--Firefox accounts for roughly a quarter of the browser usage worldwide. Third, Firefox is expanding from PCs to mobile phones and tablets with very different hardware requirements. Last, a long list of new technologies are profoundly transforming browsers into a foundation for Web applications, but many of those advancements are far from settled.

Beltzner recognizes the challenges.

""We are in it to win it,"" Beltzner said. ""It's no longer the case where it's all easy wins. There's hard work to be done here. We have to make sure we're the ones leading the charge in keeping the Web open for users.""

Mozilla established a Firefox 3.6, 3.7, and 4.0 release plan in 2009, but the organization warned early this year that the browser schedule was changing. Tuesday's Webcast offered a new schedule with no Firefox 3.7.

Why the road map change? One key feature of 3.7 called out-of-process plug-ins, which moves plug-ins such as Adobe Systems' Flash Player to their own separate memory area for better stability, was advanced to Firefox 3.6.4, code-named Lorentz and in beta testing right now. Meanwhile, Mozilla concluded it needed more time for a planned user-interface overhaul and to be liberated by a ""rebooted"" plan for a new extensions foundation called Jetpack.

So what's the schedule? If all goes well, this:

""I think we need to get to a first beta by the end of June,"" before the Mozilla Summit in early July, he said. Releasing that version ""puts us in a position where we can ship [the final version] somewhere in October or November.""

Mozilla

Is it possible? Firefox 3.6 had been due in that time frame in 2009 and slipped into early 2010. ""This is an aggressive schedule to be sure. We have to focus the efforts of projects already under way so it can come together to be a really great Firefox 4,"" Beltzner said. And programmers will have to prove the merit of any new projects very soon if they want them included.

So what else is new?

Beltzner grouped the Firefox 4 plan into three broad areas of interest: features for browser users, features for Web developers, and underlying platform features.

Tabs are one area of change for users. Tabs will be above the address bar, as is the case with Chrome, and a home tab replaces the home button. In addition, narrower application tabs can be dedicated to various Web apps. Instead of a menu bar across the top, there's a single Firefox button with a drop-down menu. Typing in the address bar can be used to switch to other tabs. One change that had been bandied about, though--a unification of the address bar and the search bar, a la Chrome--didn't appear in Beltzner's designs.

Mozilla hopes to change some dialog boxes to make them more effective. Two examples are the option for Firefox to remember a Web site's password and to permit a Web site to use the browser user's physical location.

Mozilla

Mozilla has always been motivated by the idea of giving the user control, and it's hoping the new Firefox will go further with a revamped control panel for managing passwords, cookies, pop-up blocking, geolocation, local data storage, and related details. Users could see what permissions have been granted to Web sites for each category, or alternatively, see which various permissions a specific site has.

Significant changes to the user interface can lead to confusion, but in the long run, the pain can be worthwhile, Beltzner said. Sometimes, he said, ""we're going to have to do the uncomfortable thing.""

Web developer changes

Those who design Web sites are a smaller but influential group, instrumental in getting Firefox to its present status. For them, Mozilla has a number of features planned for Firefox 4.

For Web applications, the Firefox 4 plan includes support for WebSockets, a mechanism for easier communication between the browser and a Web server. And as for dealing with the new class of touch-enabled devices, which often don't have a keyboard or mouse, Firefox should be able to let Web developers build pages controlled with a multitouch interface.

The heart of Web programming is Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), and Mozilla is building into Firefox a new HTML5 ""parser,"" the part of the browser that interprets the Web page code. The new parser can handle Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and mathematical equations interleaved with the rest of a Web page, runs as a separate computing process to improve browser responsiveness, and fixes ""dozens"" of longstanding bugs on the previous parser, Mozilla said.

In industry shorthand, HTML5 often stands for many new technologies that aren't part of the actual HTML5 specification or even the broader HTML renovation effort.

Firefox 4 will support some of those, too, but two important ones are only tentative at this stage: the newer Indexed DB effort designed to improve how information from a Web site is stored locally on a computer, and the WebGL effort to build hardware-accelerated 3D graphics into the Web. Required driver support for graphics chips complicates WebGL, and the Indexed DB specification isn't likely to be finished in time, Beltzner said.

For the movement to sidestep Flash with Web technologies, Firefox 4 has a few features planned. Some newer aspects of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), used for formatting, are set to be supported, including transitions that can animate the transformation of one Web element into another. Firefox 4 also is expected to support more of the newer CSS3 specification.

Mozilla

Also stepping on Flash's toes will be support for SMIL, the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language that can be used for some animation chores, and faster performance with the 2D drawing interface called Canvas.

Under the hood

Performance improvements to Firefox will come through improvements to the underlying software. One significant change coming is JaegerMonkey, which combines Firefox's current JavaScript engine with elements of those used in Chrome and Safari browsers.

""JaegerMonkey has reached a halfway point: we've closed about half the performance gap between our baseline performance and the competition,"" JaegerMonkey programmer David Mandelin said in a blog post Monday. However, he added, ""you can build a browser with JM [JaegerMonkey] today, but you probably won't get too far before crashing. Fixing that is next on my list.""

Also on the Firefox 4 plan is support for 64-bit processors. Operating systems have now made the jump in earnest, but not all software has followed suit.

Other hardware changes planned for Firefox 4 include support for Direct2D on Windows, a feature that lets the browser tap into the engine for hardware-accelerated graphics and text. That support exists on Windows 7 and the latest service pack of Vista, but here again, ""driver hell"" is a risk.

Support for Windows 7 interface features including Aero peek, jump lists, and icons with progress bars also are on to-do list for Firefox 4.

Support for cameras and microphones is only a tentative goal, as is tighter integration with Mac OS X.

Deeper under the covers, for security and stability reasons, Mozilla is splitting Firefox into separate memory areas with a project called Electrolysis. Its first element, out-of-process plug-ins (OOPP), is the chief feature of Firefox 3.6.4, but more is planned for Firefox 4. The new Jetpack interface moves add-ons to a separate memory area, too. Firefox 4, though, won't get the broader sandboxing design in Google's Chrome, in which browser tabs are separated from one other.

These plumbing details might sound arcane, but they're important as browsers become a foundation for ever-increasing amounts of computing chores. A Monday blog post from Firefox programmer Vladimir Vukicevic captured the essence of the matter.

""Today's Web browser is in many ways acting like a miniature full operating system,"" Vukicevic said.

Chrome 12 stable (download for Windows | Mac | Linux) doesn't contain any surprises from the Chrome 12 beta that was released a month ago, but it does bring more hardware acceleration support and better browsing security. It also marks the end of public support for Google Gears, the offline Web app tool.

The security improvements are the biggest change in version 12. In addition to 14 security holes getting patched, including five marked high priority, Google has expanded its ""Safe Browsing"" technology to include malicious file protection. It won't block all malicious file downloads, but it does do a better job of examining your downloads before they reach your hard drive. In the blog post announcing the new Chrome release, Google was careful to address privacy concerns and point out that the enhancements don't track which sites you've been downloading files from.

Another security change adds the user's ability to delete Flash cookies. This makes sense, given that Flash has come baked into Chrome for some time.

The hardware acceleration has less of an immediate impact, although it can be used immediately and really will affect Web browsing down the line as more and more people get computers with powerful graphics cards that the browser can leverage to render content, especially video, faster. In Chrome 12, 3D CSS gets some love, and if you're running Windows Vista or Mac OS X 10.6 or above, you can watch this Chrome Experiment provided by Google, which shows how 3D CSS can be used to rotate the video, change its size, and add a playlist.

As described in a blog yesterday, LastPass (download) recently followed a string of breadcrumbs that pointed to an anomaly in its network traffic on Tuesday. Though such anomalies aren't unusual, LastPass found a matching anomaly in one of its databases. Unable to identify a root cause for either anomaly, the company made the decision to assume the worst--that some of its data had been hacked.

Although LastPass hasn't identified a specific breach, it's erring on the side of caution by now forcing its members to change their master passwords. For you non-LastPass users, what exactly does that mean?

Services like LastPass and rival RoboForm let users create and manage passwords to more easily log in to the vast array of secure Web sites they visit. Those passwords can be stored on a PC or mobile device as well as online. As one means of protection, both companies typically urge users to create a single complex master password that can unlock the key to accessing their passwords. Of course, if that master password is compromised, hackers potentially can gain access to all the individual passwords, one reason why these companies advise users to employ complex master passwords.

In this case, LastPass said it believes that users with complex non-dictionary master passwords were probably safe even if any data was compromised. But the company knows that many users out of force of habit often choose simple, easily decipherable passwords. Though it sees the need to require all users to change their passwords as an overreaction, as LastPass says, ""we'd rather be paranoid and slightly inconvenience you than to be even more sorry later.""

In the meantime, LastPass says that it's taking further precautions against the anomaly by shutting down and moving certain key services and verifying all of its source code. The company is also enhancing the encryption used to protect its data.

Update 9:30 a.m. PT: LastPass is now reporting on its blog that the company is being overwhelmed by support requests and is having trouble keeping up with the number of password changes. The company has since set up a way for users to confirm their e-mail addresses without having to change their passwords. As a result, LastPass is urging people who are using the service from the same computer or IP address to hold off on changing their passwords for a few days.

""We're asking if you're not being asked to change your password then hold off--we're protecting everyone.""

The company further suggests accessing your LastPass data offline by disconnecting from the Internet and then logging in or by downloading its LastPass Pocket software, which lets you carry around your data on a USB stick.

Update 11:07 a.m. PT: Security researchers at Duo Security have also offered their take on the LastPass security anomaly with recommendations on what LastPass users should do at this point.",html
http://news.cnet.com/google-voice-flawed-but-still-awesome/,Google Voice: Flawed but still awesome,,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Google

Google's new Google Voice has a few rough edges but for many users, it could be a life-changing experience.

The service, a relaunch of GrandCentral, which Google bought in 2007, allows you to choose a local number, which will simultaneously ring up to six phones such as your cell phone, home phone, office phone, and the phone at that vacation home that most of us can only dream about.

In addition to forwarding your calls, it also takes voice messages that you can listen to on the Web, from a phone, or read, thanks to a new feature that transcribes voice messages and sends them as e-mail and text messages.

If you have multiple phones, having a single number to reach them all can make you and your callers' lives a bit easier, and it can save space on your business card by not having to list separate numbers. The concept is simple: people are trying to reach you--not one of your phones--and Google Voice lets you decide how to route the calls.

The simultaneous ring feature can also be used by groups. Team HOPE, a support network for families of missing children, gives callers a GrandCentral number that rings the phones of several staff members to ensure that calls are always answered.

I've been using a very similar ""simulring"" feature on Vonage for several years and like the fact that I get to control where my calls are forwarded. Both Google and Vonage let you configure forwarding from the Web, but Google also allows you to assign a temporary forwarding number directly from the phone. That could come in handy, if you suddenly find your cell phone out of range but have access to another number where you can be reached.

The call-recording feature is very cool. At any time during an incoming call, you can press 4 to start the recorder and 4 again to stop it. That can be handy if you're driving and someone is about to give you a phone number, address, or something else that you can't write down.

The recording feature can also be used by podcasters to record phone calls that can be exported as MP3 files. And yes, there is an announcement to inform the other party that you're recording the call.

You also get free conference calls. Up to four people can dial your phone number and can be patched into the call.

Cheap international calls

People who make occasional international calls from a cell phone will get incredible savings, compared to what the carriers charge. Using Google Voice to call a landline in London, for example, costs 2 cents a minute, compared to the whopping $1.49 that Verizon Wireless and AT&T charge, if you don't purchase an international calling plan.

Even with a calling plan, the carrier rates, though much cheaper, are still higher than what Google charges. Making calls could be easier. You dial your Google number, press 2, and then punch in 011 plus the country code and phone number.

Bugs and rough edges

I have encountered a few annoying bugs in my day 1 experience with the service. For one, I'm not able to delete voice mail from my cell phone, despite following the instructions to press 7 to ""archive"" messages. Every time I call my voice mail, those messages are still there, as if they were new. Although the voice mail transcription service works, the message isn't always delivered promptly. Sometimes it arrives in a few minutes, but at other times, it's taken up to 20 minutes.

Although not a bug and not Google's fault, it's unfortunate that you can't use your Google number as your outgoing caller ID when you dial directly from a cell phone. Although there are ways to spoof that, for security reasons, phone companies don't allow it.

The problem is that people are in the habit of you calling back on your caller ID, which makes it harder to train them to dial your Google number. Your Google caller ID will show up correctly, however, if you initiate the call from your Google Voice Web page or if you dial your own Google number and then press 2 to dial out and type in the number. This process, I suspect, is more of a hassle than it's worth.

There also isn't yet a way to transfer an existing phone number to Google, so you're stuck having to give out the new Google number. The service works only with U.S. phone numbers; you can't forward calls overseas.

Because it's an incoming service only, you can't record outbound calls, and you can't use Google Voice to add people to a call. They have to call you.

The service is currently available only to people who had previously signed up for GrandCentral. Google hasn't announced when others can sign up.

Still, despite some flaws and limitations, this could turn out to be one of Google's most beloved services. Being able to read your voice mail and having one number that rings all your phones is terrific, especially at the amazingly low price of free.

(This post has been updated to note that your Google caller ID will display correctly if you dial via the service's Web site or use the service's dial-out feature.)

On Thursday, publisher AVG Technologies, formerly known as Grisoft, plans to introduce the full version of AVG Anti-Virus 8.0. This upgrade will feature significant changes to the program, integrating the previously stand-alone tools of AVG Anti-Spyware, AVG Anti-Rootkit, and recent AVG purchase LinkScanner as well as showcasing an entirely new interface.

According to Larry Bridwell, AVG's Global Security Strategist, the guts of the program have been overhauled, too. The code rewrite, he stressed, addresses several deficiencies including system slowdowns caused by real-time shields. The integration of LinkScanner, he said, will help warn users of unsafe links, search results, and downloads before they clicked on them. On-demand definition file updates will be made available to users of the free edition for the first time, as will instant messaging protection for users of MSN and ICQ.

LinkScanner's publisher, Exploit Prevention Labs, was purchased at the end of last year. CNET's Rob Vamosi pointed out that while other safe-surfing applications tend to rely on databases, LinkScanner rated higher for using technology that determines on the fly whether a currently-loading page is tainted with malware. Previous versions have not been able to detect fraudulent pages, though, and it is unclear if that concern will be addressed in the integrated LinkScanner.

Bridwell points out that LinkScanner will be available both in the newly integrated AVG Anti-Virus and as a stand-alone download, at least in the short-term. The publisher will continue to promote an enhanced feature set in the paid edition, including tech support, more robust scheduling capabilities, and support for newer multiprocessor core chips. A trial version will still be available, although at the time of writing AVG had not yet determined how many days that trial will be.",html

That first step is the built-in Chrome module used to let Google's browser read PDF (Portable Document Format) files. Linus Upson, vice president of engineering for the Chrome team, revealed the plan in May at the Google I/O conference, and now evidence is emerging that the first step is under way.

References to the Native Client version of the PDF extension have begun cropping up on the Native Client's bug-tracking database. Programmers are encountering problems with scrollbar rendering, Gmail integration, loading PDF files, and displaying URLs when the mouse pointer hovers over a link

Some are tagged with a Chrome 14 completion schedule. That's not a commitment that the bugs will be fixed in time for the current version of Chrome under development, but it does indicate that the work is for a near-term project, not a distant idea.

Native Client, or NaCl for short, is a technology for running software within the confines of two protected sandboxes. Google expects it to combine the convenience of running JavaScript software built into Web pages with the performance of native software written for a particular operating system and processor. Using an idea called static analysis, NaCl software modules are examined in advance to make sure they don't use a particular subset of restricted operations such as writing data to a hard drive. Specially modified programming tools must be used to create Native Client modules.

Google initially pitched Native Client as a way to accelerate Web applications to native-app speeds. It demonstrated its use in processor-intensive operations such as photo manipulation and playing the game Quake. At Google I/O this year, though, CNET learned that Google plans to rebuild Chrome itself as a NaCl package. That would add an extra layer of security to the software and make it that much harder for someone to exploit the browser--or the Chrome OS operating system--as a vector for an attack.

For now, Native Client is a plug-in built into Chrome rather than the other way around. It uses a plug-in interface called Pepper. Note that NaCl is the chemical abbreviation for sodium chloride, better known as salt.

It's not clear exactly how long it will take to rebuild all of Chrome atop NaCl. Native Client itself isn't finished; for the present it's off by default, though people can experiment with it by enabling it by typing ""about:flags"" into the address bar.

Initial steps

The company is proceeding cautiously.

First, ""we have to make sure Native Client proves its way,"" Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of Chrome, said in a May interview.

""I'd say it's a dream more than a plan right now,"" added Brian Rakowski, director of product management, speaking of the effort to rebuild Chrome on NaCl.

Nevertheless, it shows the extent to which Google wants to make security a selling point for Chrome and Chrome OS. With Chrome, Google led the charge to auto-updated software that silently replaces itself with new versions. That means Chrome--or built-in components such as Adobe's Flash Player--can rapidly be replaced to shut down a newly discovered vulnerability.

Of course, it also means software can change without its users getting a say-so, but Google believes the tradeoff is worth it. That's especially the case with Chrome OS, which functions as an operating system, not merely a Web browser.

""In the Windows ecosystem, you assume the user is taking care of all of this,"" Pichai said. Google believes online software distribution can put the responsibility back where it belongs, with the software's maker.

The company stands to directly benefit from greater browser security. For example, Gmail users were the target of at least two serious hacking attempts the company said originated in China, and an Iranian attack could have granted a malicious third party an ability to create fake encryption certificates for Google.

So now, Google is modifying Chrome so Gmail can only be used over a secure connection and so secure Google sites require an encryption certificate from a short list of trusted providers.

New security risks?

One of the big factors for Native Client is that it potentially opens new security vulnerabilities. It is, after all, a new interface for executing software that isn't available today.

Native Client has passed one security exam, though. And Google got a modest endorsement from none other than John Carmack, the iD Software programmer who created Quake and Doom.

Carmack compared Native Client to WebGL, a new standard for building hardware-accelerated 3D graphics into the Web. WebGL has come under security scrutiny by Microsoft and others.

Carmack echoed Microsoft's WebGL concern in a tweet, then dropped in a good word for Native Client: ""NaCl is much, much easier to make secure than WebGL, even though it sounds scarier.""",html

Today, Mozilla has updated the Firefox 5 beta to release candidate status (download for Windows | Mac | Linux), which includes improves support for ""future-Web"" technology, speeds up the browser, and makes multiple smaller tweaks to the browser.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Following the path cut by Google with Chrome's rapid-release program, the changes to Firefox 5 are several orders of magnitude smaller than those made in Firefox 4 yet are not insignificant. Most importantly, Firefox 5 release candidate makes multiple under-the-hood tweaks to improve performance. Memory management, JavaScript rendering, canvas, and networking performance have been enhanced, and background tabs will load faster thanks to locking down the setTimeout and setInterval timeouts to 1000 milliseconds. Standards support has also been updated for coding languages like HTML5, SMIL, and MathML, and the browser now supports CSS animations.

Firefox 5 also disables cross-domain elements as the source for WebGL textures as a response to security concerns involving hardware acceleration. This will break some Web sites and prevent them from resolving properly, although Mozilla says that it is discussing solutions with WebGL developers.

In a minor interface change, Mozilla's Do Not Track header preference has been moved in an effort by the company to make it easier for users to find. Do Not Track is an effort spearheaded by multiple browser makers to get advertisers to respect the desire of people who don't want ads to track them as they browse around the Internet. It works by adding a line to a Web site's meta tags.

Also, the development channel switcher that had been introduced to the About Firefox window has been removed. This was because Mozilla discovered that most of the people using the beta and Aurora channels were running multiple installs of the browser concurrently, Johnathan Nightingale, director of Firefox development, said in a blog post. You can change Firefox development channels at will by downloading and installing each build separately, but you won't be able to change them on the fly from within an already-installed version of Firefox.

Postbox for Windows and Mac, and built on Thunderbird code the way that Flock is based on Firefox, is a new face on the e-mail field.

(Credit: CNET Networks)

Still in beta, Postbox takes desktop e-mail hard toward Web 2.0, with fast links to upload contacts to Facebook and pictures to Picasa. Click on an e-mail, and the preview pane not only shows the text, but extracts all links, images, other attachments, and contacts into a sidebar for easy management. Postbox is also obsessed with tabs, which are coming in Thunderbird 3.0 but not to this degree--at least not from what we've seen. Postbox can also upload to Twitter, FriendFeed, MySpace, del.icio.us, and Google.

When Postbox starts, you can import e-mail, contacts, and other messaging data from Thunderbird, Outlook, Google, and Yahoo. Once you get going, Postbox's tabs can be used to filter out the text of a message and focus on only attachments, images, links, or contacts. Messages themselves can also be opened in new tabs, cutting down on the excessive clutter that Web mail eliminated ages ago.

An excellent remix of a Thunderbird feature is Topics. An expansion of Thunderbird's Labels that automatically searches across folders for messages tagged with the same Topic, Postbox's is undeniably what its progenitor's should have been. Thunderbird's Labels can be configured to behave the same way, but it's not done without extra effort.

(Credit: CNET Networks)

Postbox doesn't feature all of Thunderbird's abilities. The biggest one missing is that add-ons have been killed. So while Thunderbird 2.0 can be given calendaring via the Lightning plug-in, and Thunderbird 3.0 will integrate Lightning natively, Postbox only has a To-Do list. Depending on what you're using your e-mail for, this may be a major drawback, or much ado about nothing.

Social-networking junkies who are looking for a desktop solution should take a good look at Postbox, or at least keep an eye on its progress. Support for Flickr is hopefully coming, and I'm interested in seeing how Postbox reacts once Thunderbird 3 finally leaves beta later this year, but Postbox is proof that alternative desktop e-mail clients are far from dead.",html
http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/transfer-your-data-to-a-new-iphone/,Transfer your data to a new iPhone,"October,Pm,Joshua Rotter",2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"You're eager to start using your brand-new iPhone, but if you try to manually move your apps, photos, music, documents, and contacts, your exhilaration will soon turn to frustration. Don't do it the hard way. Here's how to transfer info to your new device using iCloud or iTunes.

Back up before you transfer

First, create a current backup of all the data on your old phone. You can use iCloud or iTunes. Which one should you choose?

iCloud stores your backup in the cloud, so it doesn't take up space on your computer. iCloud encrypts your data and lets you back up over Wi-Fi, so there's no need to plug anything in.

iTunes stores your backup locally, which is great if you're nervous about the cloud, but it takes up space on your computer. iTunes encrypts your backup if you tell it to (click Encrypt Backup in the summary pane) and enables you to use backups from your computer.

Both iCloud and iTunes backups include nearly all your info and settings that are not already synced in the cloud or in other cloud services. Sensitive Apple Pay and Touch ID info cannot be backed up.

Note: If you've already set up your new iPhone, then you'll need to erase it before you can transfer a backup from iCloud or iTunes. Tap Settings, General, Reset, and Erase All Content and Settings, and then follow the instructions below.

Back up with iCloud

1. Connect to a Wi-Fi network.

2. Tap Settings, iCloud, Backup.

3. Toggle iCloud Backup on.

4. Tap Back Up Now.

iCloud will now back up your data automatically every day when your device is plugged in, on Wi-Fi, with the screen locked.

Back up with iTunes

1. Launch iTunes and connect your iPhone to your computer.

2. Save content that you downloaded from the iTunes Store or App Store by clicking File, Devices, and Transfer Purchases.

3. In the Summary pane, tap Back Up Now.

Transfer your iCloud Backup

1. Turn on your new phone.

2. Swipe from left to right and follow the steps till you arrive at the Wi-Fi screen.

3. Select your Wi-Fi network.

4. When you get to the Apps & Data screen, tap Restore From iCloud Backup.

5. Enter your Apple ID and password.

6. Choose your backup and transfer.

7. Keep your device connected to Wi-Fi until all the content is transferred.

Transfer your iTunes Backup

1. Turn on your new phone.

2. Swipe from left to right and follow the steps till you arrive on the Wi-Fi screen.

3. Connect your iPhone to your computer.

4. Tap Connect to iTunes.

5. When you get to the Apps & Data screen, tap Restore from iTunes Backup.

6. Enter your Apple ID and password.

7. Choose your backup and transfer.

8. Keep your device connected to Wi-Fi till all the content is transferred over.

http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-57418092-92/five-reasons-adobes-cs6-subscription-is-smart/,Five reasons Adobe's CS6 subscription is smart,,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Adobe Systems is about to begin a difficult -- but smart -- transition.

The San Jose, Calif.-based company will overhaul its core software business in May when it launches a subscription service called Creative Cloud, which bundles its new Creative Suite 6 products with a swath of other products and services. To make it a success, it'll have to convince customers that it's a better value than traditional software licensing.

Here's an indicator of how hard the change will be: A CNET survey in March showed a frosty reception, with 41 percent of respondents viewing Creative Cloud negatively, compared with 32 percent who viewed it positively.

And 62 percent reacted negatively to its price: Creative Cloud costs $50 monthly with a year's commitment or $75 monthly with an month-to-month option that's easier to switch on and off. A Team edition for businesses will arrive later this year at a cost of $70 per month per user for an annual commitment. And to lure existing CS3, CS4, and CS5.x customers who might be tempted to pay for perpetual-license upgrades, Adobe has an introductory offer of $30 per month.

The centerpiece of the service is access to the full Creative Suite 6 product line, which includes Photoshop CS6 for image editing, Premiere Pro and After Effects CS6 for video editing, and a host of other packages aimed at designers and creative professionals. The Creative Cloud also includes Adobe's Touch line of tablet apps, the new Edge and Muse programs for the HTML5 era of Web design, Lightroom, and a some online services such as file sharing and Web site hosting.

Adobe Systems

Creative Suite is optional. Adobe also will sell the traditional perpetual licenses to the software, either individually or in various bundles. With either the traditional sales or or the subscription, the software runs on a customer's computer. (For details on the new software, check CNET's detailed look at CS6 software.)

Adobe isn't expecting everybody to go for the subscription immediately.

""This is Adobe trying to be a little bit ahead of where the market is,"" said Scott Morris, senior marketing director for Adobe Creative Professionals. ""Some will love it and jump immediately, and others will jump over time.""

Indeed, Adobe will have to prove Creative Cloud's merits. But here are reasons why, overall, Adobe is making the right move to add it as an option.

1. Fluidly updated software

In days of yore, customers got their software on floppy disks, CDs, or DVDs. Programmers pulled together as long a list of changes as they could manage before a cutoff date.

But in the Internet era, customers increasingly download the software to begin with, followed by stream of updates, bug fixes, and security patches. Software is becoming a continuously updated project.

That means the programmers who make the software are less confined by the constraints of building a giant, monolithic release. When a feature is done, it can be added in an update distributed online immediately instead gather dust for a year or two awaiting the next major release.

In Adobe's case, it means that Creative Cloud customers will get new features before the perpetual-license crowd. ""We are planning on delivering new features that would normally go into CS7 into Creative Cloud first,"" Morris said. ""We plan new features later this year.""

This more fluid update style is increasingly common. Chrome and Firefox developers release updates every six weeks. Sun Microsystems adopted a quarterly ""release train"" for its Solaris operating system years ago. Apple releases relatively frequent updates first with Mac OS X, then with iOS. Windows Update every month stamps out another batch of security vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows and Office.

Adobe Systems

But the best example, perhaps, is Web sites and Web apps that can change every time a person loads it with a browser.

Continuous updates can make it harder for companies that must ensure various software packages get along together. But it's a powerful force sweeping the industry.

2. Online services

If a Creative Cloud subscriber is running Photoshop or Dreamweaver, the program and its files still are stored on the local computer, so it's not as if the Creative Cloud is some sort of Adobe equivalent of Google Apps.

But the Creative Cloud comes with a range of online services. And this, too, is an important trend in the computing industry Adobe is wise to tap into.

The spotlight is a Dropbox-like ability to sync files across Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android devices; subscriptions come with 20GB of storage space for the service. And a later company-focused version of the Creative Cloud, a more expensive plan at $70 per month for a year's subscription, will offer more, though details won't emerge until later this year.

Another important service is Adobe's Business Catalyst hosting service, which lets subscribers run up to 5 Web sites. It's of course integrated with Adobe's design software such as its new Muse tool that debuts in the CS6 suite, and they also can use the downloadable fonts in Adobe's TypeKit service for a more polished look.

And there are also social tools to show off designs, comment on others' work, share tips, and the like. It's not clear the world needs another social network, but Adobe would be foolish not to try to become more of a hub of activity for its many customers.

So far the online tools pale in comparison to the CS6 software. But as the Internet becomes steadily more capable at running apps, and Adobe's customers become steadily more interested in publishing on it, online services grow more important.

3. Lower barrier to entry

Adobe has a strong reputation for impressive design products, but at a cost of hundreds of dollars for individual titles and hundreds or thousands for suites, many prospective customers are doubtless deterred.

But $75 to use all the Creative Suite products for a month? That's a much easier commitment to make. Even $600 over the course of a year is compelling compared to $2,600 for the whole Master Collection.

Of course, there are caveats: customers will have to keep on paying to keep on using it, and not all of them need the full suite, and existing Master Collection customers can pay only $549 to upgrade to CS6. But providing a lower-cost entry point is a good idea.

Adobe Systems

And there are cheaper subscriptions, too, for individual titles such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro. They can be had via subscription for $20 a month for the most part; the new Muse and Edge tools will cost $15 a month each.

Adobe also has a discounted plan for students that costs $30 a month. It requires a full-year commitment, but Adobe is considering a single-semester option.

There's no option for an even lower price over a longer period, say three years, but Adobe has kicked around the idea, Morris said. ""We're definitely open to that,"" but it's not part of the short term plan, he said.

And there's one more option to mention, a three-month subscription that third-party companies such as Amazon will be able to sell. ""It's like buying gift card for Pottery Barn,"" Morris said.

4. Bundling bonanza

The Creative Cloud comes in one size only: everything.

That means customers who might otherwise have opted for a subset of Adobe products will get access to more -- and perhaps acquire a taste for them. Take for example the $1,300 Design Standard collection, which includes Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Acrobat Pro. Subscribing to the Creative Cloud, a customer might also discover that Dreamweaver, Edge, and Premiere Pro useful.

Oh, and how about Lightroom? And you can publish magazines to iPads with the Digital Publishing Suite? The full smorgasboard is available.

It's a great way to hook customers on packages they might not have sprung for individually. And if they prove their worth, the customers will keep on paying for them.

Adobe has some reason to be optimistic. Years ago, it introduced bundles when it moved to its Creative Suite strategy. Customers were frosty on the idea initially, but no more.

""When we first had the idea of creative suites, initially a lot of customers said it's a terrible idea,"" Morris said. ""Now 75 percent of our units sold are suites.""

5. Adobe's business benefits

One of the big benefits of subscriptions is that businesses move from bursts of revenue to recurring revenue. That smooths out quarter-to-quarter financial results and ideally, from the perspective of the company doing the selling, means customers keep on paying year after year.

""You have more predictable revenue when you amortize your earnings over a 12-month period compared to a heavy reliance on upgrade cycles,"" Morris said.

Adobe's quarterly earnings have always been something of a roller coaster as new versions of its products drive sales, but then purchasing drops off during the lulls. Why buy a product if you guess its replacement is coming in a few months and you don't really need it?

With subscriptions, a customer can get in on the action whenever it's convenient, and the upgrade will arrive at no extra cost.

Opera 11 alpha for Windows, Mac, and Linux is notable at this point for bringing extensions to the closed-source browser, a feature not in earlier versions of Opera that has been a key selling point for Google Chrome. Extensions, which add extra functions to browsers, have recently come to Apple Safari, too.

Opera 11 alpha's extensions are also a further indication of the standardization of extension coding. WebKit-based Chrome and Safari use extension formats that are nearly-identical combinations of JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS, and Mozilla's new JetPack framework promises to introduce the formula to Firefox, too. Plug-ins for Internet Explorer 9 beta use a proprietary add-on system, as does Mozilla's older open-source format. Standardizing add-on coding could easily lead to significantly less work for extension publishers

Given that Opera has long offered a synchronization service called Opera Link, it wouldn't be surprising to see Opera 11 incorporate extension synchronization before the upgrade is finished. Another new feature in Opera 11 is a new open API for Opera Link that has been provided to developers to further the uses of the synchronization service.

The company also provided for developers guidelines for writing extensions and a Web site for uploading completed extensions.

Opera promised in a press release that the company will check all extensions to ensure that malware and defects don't creep in. This is a similar claim to those made by other browser publishers that support add-ons, although there has been malware that occasionally slips through.",html

That means many PC users must upgrade to a more secure, supported version of Windows or risk their un-updated, unpatched version of Windows XP catching a virus or other Internet bug. As a rule of thumb, we recommend upgrading your OS and then updating it often to protect your system. If you're switching to a new OS, read how to migrate easily from Windows XP. However, if you're a die-hard who wants to keep an XP machine, here are five tips for keeping it running as safely and smoothly as possible until you upgrade.

1. Use updated browsers -- no more Internet Explorer

The latest version of Internet Explorer for Windows XP is Internet Explorer 8, an incredibly outdated browser. For security, it's better to use third-party browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Opera. All have promised to continue Windows XP support for at least another year.

While you're installing a better browser, turn up your browser security. Add-ons and extensions that disable JavaScript can prevent websites from running malicious scripts. NoScript and Ghostery for Firefox or NotScripts and ScriptSafe for Chrome can close the doors on many exploits.

2. Get rid of Flash, Java, and Adobe Reader

Although Flash, Java, and Adobe Reader were the mainstays of yesteryear's Internet, with an unsupported OS they are gaping doors for hackers. Most video sites like YouTube and Netflix uses HTML5, so there should be no need for Flash. Java is still required for certain applications, but unless you use those on a daily basis, there's no need for it to be installed. Lastly, there are safer alternatives for Adobe Reader, such as Sumatra PDF, Nitro PDF, and Foxit Reader.

3. Buy a full antivirus suite

Getting the protection of a full antivirus suite isn't a bad idea, especially when it costs much less than upgrading to a new system. Kaspersky, Trend Micro, F-Secure, and Norton are all good calls. You want something heavy-duty with its own firewall for the best protection. Then get a second opinion from other scanners just to be on the safe side. Malwarebytes Anti-Malware is good utility to run as a second line of defense.

4. Go offline or limit your account access

The surest way to stay safe is to stay off the Internet. If your Windows XP machine's uses don't require an Internet connection (for instance, if you're using it for offline home theater viewing, music, or games), then disconnect. Otherwise use the limited account privilege setting in the User Control Panel. Stay off the admin account unless you need to update, patch, or install something. Account limitation can be a roadblock for attackers.

5. Remove unnecessary clutter

Any programs you're not using can be a risk now that you're on an outdated OS. Keep baggage to the bare minimum by uninstalling apps you don't need. IObit, Revo, and Advanced Uninstaller can help. Then update whatever applications remain. Just because Microsoft stopped supporting Windows XP doesn't mean that software developers are dropping it, too. A majority of publishers will still offer updates to their software for at least for another year.

End of an era

Even though Windows XP gets no more Microsoft love, your functioning PC did not suddenly became useless. If you practice good security and know the limitations of the legacy OS, you can stretch your system's life for a little while longer. However, we recommend that you not keep sensitive data or perform essential tasks on your XP machine. While ""unsupported"" doesn't mean automatic hacking, there will be fewer people reporting exploits.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-20105203-75/microsofts-bold-new-look-and-feel-for-windows/,Microsoft's bold new look and feel for Windows,,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"ANAHEIM, Calif.--Microsoft has characterized just about every Windows launch since Windows 95 as the biggest change to computer operating systems since that product debuted 16 years ago.

This time, it might actually be true.

The software giant will start to unveil Windows 8 this morning to 5,000 developers at the Anaheim Convention Center and the company's Build conference, which will run through the rest of the week. In a preview for journalists and analysts provided in advance of the event, company executives ran the nascent operating system through its paces, demonstrating sweeping changes to the way people will use their PCs.

Steven Sinofsky, president of the Windows and Windows Live division at Microsoft described the new operating system as ""a bold re-imagination of what Windows could be.""

There's little doubt Windows needs some re-imagining. It's still the dominant operating system for PCs, used by more than 1 billion people worldwide. But PC growth has slowed to a crawl. Just last week, research firm Gartner revised its 2011 PC growth rates down to an anemic 3.8 percent increase in 2011. At the same time, mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, notably Apple's iPad, are posting huge gains and taking on tasks that had once been the sole domain of PCs.

Windows 8 isn't just another operating system. It's a crucial bid by Microsoft to remain at the heart of computing as the industry grows well beyond the PC. The new operating system will run on PCs, even those that currently run Windows 7. But it also supports touch computing, meaning it can run tablets as well. It even supports a pen-based interface.

The changes start with the interface--the look of the operating system and the way users interact with it. Microsoft gave a peek at the new look at the D9 conference in June, showing a desktop experience that closely resembled the interface the company created for Windows Phone 7 devices.

Microsoft

Rather than the familiar desktop photo covered with application and file icons, the new Metro user interface features square or rectangular tiles. Some are static, such as the Internet Explorer or Control Panel tile. But others include dynamic content. So the calendar tile, for example, includes details of upcoming appointments. A weather tile has the forecast for your chosen city. And a music player can show the album art and the track listing of a song playing in the background.

""Icons are yesterday's way of representing apps,"" said Jensen Harris, partner director of program management in the Windows Experience group. ""Tiles are the more modern way of representing apps.""

Tiles keep content flowing to the desktop, so that useful information surfaces for users rather than requiring them to fetch it.

""The idea is that you are always up to date about what's going on. You are always getting drawn into the apps,"" Harris said. ""The serendipity of the Web is being brought into Windows.""

When users click on any application in the Metro interface, they'll find a new immersive experience. Those programs take up the entire computer screen. There's no so-called chrome around the app, the frame that separates it from other apps and the desktop. There's no toolbar on the bottom of the desktop. And the new Windows 8 user interface gets rid of the multiple Windows screens for which the operating system itself was named.

""For years, Windows has been about the chrome,"" Harris said. ""Now we're saying we're humble. We're at the service of the app.""

To be clear, Microsoft will continue to offer the familiar Windows user interface. And some Windows functions, such as the task manager, will only be available in the traditional Windows interface.

""We don't think the desktop is some place you never, ever want to go, like the penalty box,"" Sinofsky said.

But Microsoft is pushing the Metro interface. And with its large tiles, Metro is very much about touch computing, the advent of which Microsoft largely missed.

""While we were developing Windows 7, touch took off everywhere,"" said Julie Larson-Green, corporate vice president in the Windows Experience group. ""People want to be able to, and expect to be able to, touch the screen.""

Competing with the iPad

So while Windows 8 can run computers that use mice and keyboards, it will also be Microsoft's first full-fledged attempt to compete with the iPad in tablet computing. The company demoed the new operating system on a variety of devices, created by partners such as Acer and Samsung, that included touch interfaces. But it offered no details about those devices at the preconferance preview. Some were tablets. Some were laptops that had touch screens. And one device was an oversize monitor with tiles that could be touched to launch or opened with a mouse.

And Windows 8 supports multitouch as well. It expands on the familiar pinch-to-zoom feature found in many smartphones and tablets. Users can pinch two fingers together to zoom out from the start screen itself, not just within an application such as a Web browser or photo viewer. By zooming out of the start page, something Microsoft calls semantic zoom, users can reorganize tiles into groups, such as games, and organize those groups to their liking.

Windows 8 won't just change the way users interact with computers, it's also going to change the way developers think about creating their applications. Microsoft will be pushing hard at the conference and in coming weeks for developers to create ""Metro-style"" applications. The company knows that to compete with the iPad, it needs to offer a huge selection of touch-based applications that are compelling for customers.

In addition to running through the tools that it will provide to help developers create those applications, the company will also give a peek at its idea for a Windows Store, where customers can download those Metro-style apps directly to their devices. Microsoft is pitching the store as a way to reach the widest computing audience in the world. But unlike Apple, which only allows application sales for the iPad through its App Store, Microsoft will also let developers sell their programs directly to users.

Despite the daylong briefing, there are still plenty of unanswered questions. Maybe the biggest is the level of support for tablets running on ARM processors. Microsoft broke the news at the Consumer Electronics Show in January that Windows 8 would run on ARM architectures, not just the x86 chips from Intel and AMD that have been a staple of the Windows franchise. It's been unclear, though, how existing applications would work on ARM chips, because of the different architecture.

Sinofsky said Microsoft won't port existing programs to the ARM architecture. That means ARM tablets will be able to run only Metro-style apps, which could limit their appeal.

Windows 8 will no doubt win kudos for its look and feel. But it's also bound to unnerve some corporate buyers, who won't want to deal with the cost and time of training employees how to use the new operating system.

Meanwhile, developers, whom Microsoft is working to woo at the Build conference, will have to rethink some of their applications to take advantage of the Metro user interface. For some, it will be a welcome change, a move into a world where rivals have an early advantage. But for others, the new interface will undoubtedly pose challenges.

Perhaps the biggest question is whether consumers want one device that doubles as a tablet and PC. For now, Apple is betting on two separate devices. That's why the iPad runs a different operating system than its MacBooks and Macs. Microsoft hopes to convince users that one device will be all they'll need.

The company hasn't offered details on when Windows 8 will launch, though many analysts expect it to debut sometime in 2012.",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20012280-12.html,Tighter security coming in Firefox 4,"July,Pm,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"LAS VEGAS--A new JavaScript engine, HTML5, tabs on top, and a new add-on framework are not the only improvements that users can expect in Firefox 4. At Black Hat on Wednesday, a trio of security representatives from Mozilla detailed how the company plans to push the browser to be more secure for users while nudging developers toward safer coding practices.

(Credit: Mozilla)

One of the biggest fixes that's been implemented in the Firefox 4 beta (Windows | Mac | Linux) repairs a hole that affects all browsers, a decade-old vulnerability that was mentioned in the documentation for CSS2. The exploit is a CSS sniffing history attack, where malicious code can gain access to your browser history by manipulating link appearance and style. What made the bug so difficult to repair is that the simplest solution, to prevent all link style manipulation, would be like throwing the baby out with the bathwater, said Firefox's director of development, Jonathan Nightingale. Changing an already-visited link's colors is one the most-used features of the Web, and it would be catastrophic to prevent that.

Mozilla's David Baron figured out how to solve the problem with a three-pronged approach that focuses on the user instead of the Web site. His solution limits what aspect of links can be tweaked to color, then ""lies"" through JavaScript so that although the page queries the link and reports back what it would look like if it was unvisited, the one that Mozilla's engine draws is the correct one, whether it's been visited or not. This solution also limits the amount of computation that the rendering engine needs to do, said Nightingale, which allows the focus to remain on the content and reduces the overall ""heavy lifting"" required to render it properly. ""By limiting the link, there's fewer options for [link exploits that look like] dancing bananas.""

Nightingale added that Wednesday's release of Safari 5.0.1 has incorporated the fix.

Another type of bug addressed in the Firefox 4 beta is an XSS primary scripting exploit. Brandon Sterne, security program manager at Firefox, said that Firefox's new Content Security Policy directly addresses these kinds of problems. They present a unique challenge, he said, because a fundamental problem with a Web site is that, ""it's a document that pulls in all these different resources [text, video, or audio] into one document, treated with the same privilege. So it's hard for the browser to know what was intended and was injection. With Content Security Policy we by default turn it all off, forcing the Web site to turn it on one at time.""

While that may sound like the CSP creates an unnecessarily large burden on developers, Sterne added that the CSP is designed to be backward-compatible with existing Web sites. ""It requires developers to opt in,"" he said, ""but sites that don't recognize the header will just do business as usual. Research being shown here at Black Hat shows that JavaScript frame-busting doesn't work anymore, so this addresses that.""

The CSP can be implemented site-wide or only on specific pages within a site by including the relevant line code in the header. Mozilla anticipates that many large content-hosting Web sites will find the short-term investment of time to use the CSP worth the long-term safety results.

As HTML5 and other, newer technologies develop and mature into standardized code, there's a great potential for new security risks to open up. Nightingale spoke about one such vector: shaders. Shaders are not new, but their implementation in WebGL and OpenGL is, and could potentially open up new breaches. While he wouldn't go into specifics, he did say that Mozilla was ""spending a lot of time taking [shaders] apart, and making sure that we have good validation of our assumptions.""

Browsing security means more than applying patches to vulnerabilities. Nightingale pointed out that the biggest security fix for Firefox 3 was implementing the session saver, which made it easier for users to recover open tabs after shutting down the browser. By allowing users to more or less pick up where they left off, Nightingale said, it encouraged them to apply updates more regularly, including minor-point but important security updates.

Other changes in Firefox 4 promise to be less technical. Firefox's approach to browser updates is changing, and sounds like in some cases it will more closely resemble Google Chrome's automatic updates. ""There are updates that we want you to know about, and that you'll have a choice to install or not, but there's also updates that we just want to get our security patches out,"" said Nightingale. Those silent updates will be rolled out first to Windows users because Windows experience the most security risks, he said, but Mac and Linux users will eventually see them, too.

Even with the stronger competition from Chrome, Mozilla says that Firefox remains an industry trend-setter. The company is looking at the HTML5 geolocation feature and how to maintain privacy. ""We know that people will look at our implementation and see how we do it,"" said Nightingale. ""We don't send any private information, and if we don't then nobody else will either. We're trying to put more of that control in users hands.""

In Firefox 4, users can expect the geolocation notifications to be ""friendlier."" At this stage of development, it looks like you'll be able to ignore all geolocation alerts, turn off the service completely, or go back to change your original selection.

The Weave syncing service, which recently changed its name to Firefox Sync, encrypts all of its data locally before sending it up to the cloud. Once in the cloud Mozilla says that the data is inaccessible without the user's password, which is stored locally.

The out-of-process plug-in feature that debuted in Firefox 3.6.4 for Windows and Linux and is coming in Firefox 4 for Macs, originally code-named ""electrolysis,"" will eventually include isolated content processes and the new add-on framework known as Jetpack. This means that when one of those add-ons or content-processes crashes, the entire browser won't get pulled down.

""Electrolysis gives you two sets of orthogonal benefits,"" said Nightingale. One is the protection of existing processes, and the other has a direct impact on comparatively low-powered mobile phones. ""When content goes runaway, it doesn't hurt the UI responsiveness, and on mobile that matters even more."" Nightingale said that users shouldn't be surprised to see the results of the electrolysis process isolation in mobile Firefox first.

Security vulnerability disclosure is a complex problem facing browser publishers today, one that requires a balance between public dissemination of the bug and withholding the specifics of the breach until it's been patched. With Google calling its policy ""responsible disclosure"" and Microsoft labeling it ""coordinated disclosure,"" Nightingale said that he doesn't get hung up on nomenclature. ""I would always rather people work with us on making the Internet a better place, rather than them not telling us. Once the bug is fixed, we open it up and share how the sausage was made.""

At the root of browser security lies the question of how to balance user education such as not clicking on ads that promise you that ""You've Won!"" or that you need to run their remote virus scanner, with pre-emptive security tactics, such as patching holes but also exposing or blocking bad Web site behavior. For example, Comodo's Chromium remix, Dragon, takes an aggressive stance on ensuring certificates have been properly written, which is why that browser warns you before you go to Facebook.com.

As Nightingale lamented, though, ""We're not all using the same terminology."" Improving common standards for reporting and dealing with threats could fix that, but there's little indication that the five major browser publishers are about to collaborate and share the burden of security risks.",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-57377496-12/with-mountain-lion-apple-brings-ios-and-os-x-a-big-step-closer/,"With Mountain Lion, Apple brings iOS and OS X a big step closer","February,Am,Kent German",2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"There's a good reason that people use the word ""ecosystem"" when discussing Apple products.

Indeed, the company has spent the last couple of years pushing the idea that customers should have the same user experience regardless of which device is in their hands. And now, just as iOS has evolved to unify that experience across the iPad, iPhone, and iPad Touch, the latest version of OS X brings the Mac further into the fold.

Announced today as Mountain Lion (v10.8), the update brings many of the features born in iOS 5 and plants them on the desktop. Some of the additions, like Notes, Reminders, and iMessage, are strictly functional, while others, like AirPlay Mirroring, iCloud, and a deep Game Center integration, spread the content love across your Apple-integrated universe. And don't assume that Mountain Lion just rehashes what you've already seen, for it also delivers a new security feature that keeps Apple at the forefront of malware protection.

Since we're nowhere near the final version of Mountain Lion (that will come this summer), I won't have an official CNET review or performance benchmarks quite yet. But after using an early preview of the developer release for a few days, I can walk you through 10 feature highlights and describe the user experience. To someone who's covered the iPhone and iOS since that very first handset five years ago, it was abundantly clear what Apple is trying to do here. In fact, from the moment I cracked open a MacBook Air with Mountain Lion onboard I was in familiar territory.

We'll expand on this First Take over the next few months as Apple announces more features. And as you read on, keep in mind that the interface that I'm describing here may change at any time. Once the customer release of Mountain Lion climbs into the Mac App Store, though, you can rest assured that we'll pull out all the review stops.

Messages

Though hardly glamorous or shiny, iMessage was one of the better features of iOS 5. It provided yet another way to keep in touch, and because it lived outside of your wireless carrier's realm, you could send everything from text to photos without adding a penny to your cell phone bill. Seriously, who doesn't love that?

Granted, bypassing your carrier's clutches isn't a concern when messaging on a Mac, but Mountain Lion's iMessage app is just as easy to use. You'll find all of the same features, including delivery and read receipts, encrypted messaging, support for media and contacts, and a typing indicator. You can send messages to an iPhone number or e-mail address (assuming your friend's device also has iOS 5 or Mountain Lion) and you can talk to a group at once. And thanks to iCloud, your chats are pushed to all of your Apple devices.

As iMessage replaces the iChat app, you'll need an Apple ID to get started. The interface is largely similar to the mobile experience while showing a few differences such as a list of chats on the left side and a longer conversation display. I loved that you could launch FaceTime from the app, though I'd prefer a button for adding photos directly into your conversation (like you get in the messaging app on the iPhone). Yes, you can open a photo on your desktop and drag it over to your chat window, but that involves a couple of additional steps. Hopefully, Apple will address this in the final version of Mountain Lion.

Reminders

Another iOS 5 import, the Reminders app also brings the same features while adding a few more goodies. You can make a to-do list, set due dates for alerts, and push your information to all devices. Thanks to your Mac's larger display there's also a search field for finding buried reminders and a calendar for viewing reminders tied to a specific date.

The only feature not carried over from iOS 5 is the ability to set a geofence for a task. That means, of course, that you can't set your Mac to remind you to ""call home"" when you leave work and then receive the notice when you're out the door. I don't think that's a huge loss, but it's worth pointing out just the same.

Notes

Here again, though the basics of typing a note are unchanged, the interface has been modified and enhanced for use on a Mac. Now you can use rich text, make bullet or numbered lists, search for notes, and add a photo. Adding links is a promised feature, as well, though I wasn't able to use it at the time of this writing. There's also a sharing app for sending a note via e-mail or iMessage and you can pin a note to your desktop to keep it always visible. And just like with iMessage and Reminders, you can see a list of all Notes on the left side of the app and you can push content to all devices linked to your iCloud account.

Notifications

Apple took a big step forward when it introduced the Notification Center in iOS 5. As Android fans will point out, the pull-down menu wasn't novel, but it did improve the user experience immensely. And with Mountain Lion, Apple has carried the feature over to the Mac while shaking it up a bit.

You start by configuring notifications in the Systems Preferences menu. The feature works with a broad assortment of apps, including e-mail, iMessages, missed FaceTime calls, Twitter mentions and direct messages, event reminders, and calendar invites, but you can select only the apps that you want to use. When notifications and alerts arrive they'll appear in the top right corner of your screen. The former will disappear after 5 seconds while the latter will stay on the screen until you dismiss them.

To access the full Notification Center, just slide two fingers across the trackpad from its right edge. You'll then see your full notifications list on the right side of your screen. Only the five most recent notifications from each app are visible (you can choose to view fewer) and you can dismiss them by clicking the box on the right side (similar to iOS). Fortunately, you can access the Notification Center from anywhere on your Mac.

Twitter integration

Granted, this may not sound exciting if you don't use Twitter, but it does further demonstrate Apple's unifying intentions with Mountain Lion. As with iOS, you now can tweet directly from a variety of apps as long as you've integrated your Twitter account. I used it with Photo Booth and Safari, but it also works with Quick Look and Preview. The user experience was seamless and worked just as it does on iOS.

You also can add a location and integrate your list of Twitter pals with the profiles in the Contacts app. Still to come is Mac App Store integration so you can tweet a link to an app directly from the store.

iCloud integration

As the first major Mac OS release since the introduction of iCloud, Mountain Lion opens access to cloud-based features so you can keep up with important info on all your devices. As mentioned, Notes, Reminders, and iMessages created on your Mac will be synced with other devices. And in turn, when you initiate those apps on a mobile device like an iPad or iPhone, the content will appear on your Mac.

A couple of iCloud features will not be available in the developer version I used, but Apple says they are coming soon. First off will be the ability to view, create, and edit the same iCloud documents from your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Any changes made on any device will be reflected on all devices through iCloud. Also coming is a new Document Library that will launch with apps that support Documents in the Cloud. Besides giving you access to your latest documents regardless of where they were created, it'll mean you'll also be able to create Document folders in much the same way you create folders on iOS (drag and drop a document on top of another). You'll also have a Share button built in to the Document Library so you can quickly send a document via Mail, Messages, or AirDrop.

Game Center

The gaming hub that has been a big success on iOS devices, with more than 100 million registered users, will now be available for Mac in Mountain Lion. Though it is not yet available in my preview of the new OS, Apple says you'll be able to set up and personalize your gaming experience with a Game Center app for Mac. As with the iOS app, you'll be able to view friends already in your gaming network and discover new gaming fans through Game Center recommendations.

Apple says that Game Center for Mac will come with all the bells and whistles found in the iOS version, including the vast user base already registered for the service. You'll be able to discover new friends; browse games your friends are playing; view leaderboards to see how your scores match up; and earn achievements in games across all your devices. You'll also be able to play multiplayer games across all your devices (with friends or automatched opponents), participate in in-game voice chat, and receive Game Center notifications. Apple says the Game Kit for developers will include tools for creating multiplayer games that can be played on a Mac or your favorite iOS device.

Share Sheets

While I'm on the subject of sharing, Mountain Lion adds an easy way to share photos, videos, and links from within an app. After clicking the share icon imported form iOS, you'll be able to create Share Sheets and then pass on the content via Mail, message, AirDrop, and popular third-party social-networking sites.

I like that the Share button detects the file type selected and only lists sharing options that are appropriate for that file type. So if you're looking at a Web page in Safari, for example, you'll have options to share via e-mail, Message, or Twitter. While Share Sheets are not a groundbreaking new feature, they will obviate the need to drag files or links to other apps before sending. Apple says that the Share Sheet API will let developers take advantage of sharing services as well, so people will able to share with others using third-party apps with a consistent and convenient interface.

AirPlay Mirroring

I hate to use the word ""ecosystem"" again, but that's definitely what this feature is all about. With AirPlay Mirroring, you can take what's on your Mac and present it on an HDTV via Apple TV. The video stream is 720p and it will match the resolution of the external screen that you're using. Apple hasn't activated this feature yet so I wasn't able to use it, but it sounds very cool.

Gatekeeper

In an app-centric universe, security concerns continue to evolve beyond the common question of whether you should download that attachment in an unfamiliar e-mail. Fortunately, Apple's app stores both for the Mac and iTunes have always offered a deep level of protection, but a new feature called Gatekeeper spins it in a new direction.

In addition to existing OS X features like download validation and blocklists, Gatekeeper lets users choose where their apps can originate. If you don't want to take any chances, you can choose to allow apps only from the Mac Store, but if you're looking for more freedom you can designate all third-party apps as acceptable. You can mark your selection in the Security & Privacy menu in System preferences.

Most people, however, don't see things just in black and white, which is why I think the third option will be the most popular. Smack in the middle of the two extremes, it lets users download all apps from the Mac App Store and all third-party developers that are signed with an Apple Developer ID. Any approved Apple developer can obtain an ID, which the developer can assign to titles that live outside Apple's stores. Then, when Mountain Lion detects a Developer ID on a third-party app, it will confirm that the title is not malware, that it has not been tampered with, and that the developer is not known to have distributed malware.

For the security-conscious (which, in all seriousness, should be everyone), the Developer ID is an impressive step forward in protection. Screening the apps in your own store is one thing, but adding the ability to track titles living elsewhere is quite another. What's more, it's a step that none of Apple's rivals are taking. Of course, there are some obvious concerns such as whether an ID is still tracked if the developer leaves Apple's program. Apple hasn't answered that question yet, but I imagine that we'll get more information in the final release.

Conclusion

When Apple announces a new ""cat"" with an OS X upgrade, you know that it's about more than just bug fixes and interface tweaks. With Mountain Lion, the same rule applies. Though most of the features (Gatekeeper being an obvious exception) are familiar and not monumentally significant, the upgrade significantly changes the user experience. By bringing iOS features to the desktop, unifying the interface, and pushing your data to multiple devices, it marks a closer union between the Mac and Apple's mobile devices. And as CNET's Scott Stein will tell you, that's something that we've needed for a long time.

As mentioned, we'll save making our final assessment of Mountain Lion until we get the final version. But even in this early preview, it's clear what Apple's intentions are.

Native Client, or NaCl for short, is an ambitious Google project that, if successful, will help close one gap that separates Web applications from those that run natively on a computer's operating system. That would improve the competitive position of Web applications such as Google Docs compared to Microsoft Office--and thereby boost Google's Chrome OS project in comparison with Windows.

Most Web browsers run programs written in JavaScript or perhaps Flash, both of them running on a programming foundation that makes those programs slower than native software. But Native Client lets programmers write software that directly taps into x86 chip models such as AMD's Athlon or Intel's Core. Secial programming tools and a screening mechanism in the Native Client software itself are designed to provide security for what has historically been the risky process of downloading executable programs from the Net

Chrome Version: 4.0.220.1, released Friday, ""introduces the Native Client as a built-in feature for the first time on Windows,"" said Jonathan Conradt, a Google engineering program manager, in a blog post about the release. Previously the software was available only as a browser plug-in.

Google also offers a variety of basic tests and more elaborate examples of what Native Client can do, though it takes a bit of technical configuration to get them working. Among them are spinning ray-traced globes, the Game of Life, and the Quake first-person shooter video game.

Native Client shows how Google is using Chrome as a vehicle to advance its Web programming agenda. While some competitors such as Microsoft have a strong business of software that runs natively on a computer, Google wants software to run on central servers on the Internet.

This cloud computing approach has some advantages--being able to more easily collaborate and share documents for example, or to see and edit documents using any PC or smartphone. Google was born on the Web and has an incumbent's advantage there over rivals, but as an applications foundation, the Web remains slow and primitive compared to native applications in many regards.

Native Client isn't the only effort to change that situation. Google also has a plug-in called O3D--also a project it's building into Chrome--designed to let programs tap into hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. It works at a higher programming level than a related effort from Mozilla and Firefox called WebGL.

Google first released Native Client in December 2008. In June 2009, declaring confidence in NaCl's security model, Google it announced it was bringing Native Client out of research and into production.

Though Native Client is built into the new Chrome version, there are plenty of qualifiers for the release. First, it's only in the developer preview version of Chrome, and only for Windows right now. Second, it's disabled by default; adding ""--internal-nacl"" as a command-line switch at Chrome launch will activate it, according to an explanatory page.

The new version of Chrome offers a variety of other features too, notably a number updates for extensions to let people customize the browser.

For example, extensions now appear as an option on the wrench menu for browser settings. More obviously from a user-interface perspective, the browser actions interface (see illustration below) is now available to place extensions in the form of a button to Chrome's main toolbar.",html

But how do they perform when tested under identical conditions?

CNET put the latest stable versions of Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer through a gauntlet of benchmarks that considered JavaScript and HTML5 performance, as well as boot times and memory usage. (Opera and Safari were not tested because they have not been updated recently, and neither has yet implemented hardware acceleration close to the level that the other three browsers have.) Note that these charts are at best a snapshot in time, and are dependent on the hardware being used and any extensions installed. The full charts are below, followed by analysis and an explanation of our methodology.

*JSGamebench was conducted by Facebook developers. The test was included because it's a publicly available test of real-world gameplay, though we opted to use Facebook's published data for simplicity's sake. The hardware acceleration using WebGL results were not included because only Firefox 4 and Chrome 11 were included in the test group, and Chrome 11 was not tested by CNET this round because it's still in beta.

Chrome 10 Internet Explorer 9 Firefox 4 SunSpider 0.9.1 (ms) 336.20 250.60 292.37 Kraken (ms) 8,806.30 15,606.77 7265.13 V8 v6 (higher is better) 5,173.67 2,235.33 3540.33 JSGamebench 0.3* (higher is better) 322.00 1,156.00 1,482.00 Boot time (s) 26.22 21.86 17.80 Memory (kb) 390,532 205,616 148,020

Though the competition is extremely close in some cases--especially JavaScript rendering--Firefox 4 is strongly favored by HTML5 processing, boot time, and memory usage. Overall, I'd judge from these results that Firefox 4 is the winner this time around.

Chrome, however, is absolutely killing it on Google's V8 benchmark. Expect the next version of Chrome to perform much better on the JSGamebench test, once hardware acceleration has been fully enabled. You currently have to toggle a few switches in about:flags to get it all. Also expect Chrome's boot time and memory performance to improve--Google has said it plans to spend more time working on Chrome's memory hogginess in the coming versions.

Given the renewed resurgence in Internet Explorer, it's also hard to imagine that the IE development team isn't already working on making the browser better.

Also of interest is that the SunSpider results are extremely close. The gulf between 250 milliseconds and 290 milliseconds is just not going to be that detectable by the average person.

How we tested

Our test machine was a Lenovo T400, with an Intel Core 2 Duo T9400 chip running at 2.53GHz, with 3GB of RAM, using Windows 7 x86. We used four publicly available tests: WebKit SunSpider 0.9.1, Mozilla Kraken 1.0, Google V8 version 6, and JSGameBench 0.3. All tests except for JSGamebench were conducted using a ""cold boot"" of the browser, that is, both the computer and the browser being tested were restarted before each test. Each test was performed three times, and the results you see are the averages. Browsers had all extensions and add-ons deactivated for the tests.

We opened five Web sites for all tests, in addition to any test site. These were: talkingpointsmemo.com, aol.com, youtube.com, newyorktimes.com, giantbomb.com, cnettv.cnet.com.

The boot time benchmarks were conducted by manually starting a stopwatch when clicking on the browser's taskbar icon, and then hitting stop when the last tab's resolving indicator stopped rotating. One half-second was subtracted from Internet Explorer 9's pre-averaged times to account for the extra time it took to hit the Reload previous session link, since the browser doesn't support that feature the way Firefox 4 and Chrome 10 do.

The memory test was conducted by opening the aforementioned set of tabs and looking at Google Chrome's memory manager. You can access it by typing ""about:memory"" into the Chrome location bar. The figure we used is the Private Memory, which only totals memory used by the browser that's not shared by other processes. It's also useful because it tallies all of Chrome's open tab memory usage into one convenient number.",html

Currently available for free in public beta, Catalyst allows corporate IT departments to force certain sites to open in different browsers. It works in three browsers, Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer, and installs a Catalyst add-on in each. That add-on runs in conjunction with a management program that the IT department uses to set rules that tell specific sites to open in specific browsers.

Gary Schare, CEO of Browsium, said Catalyst's goal is to solve several corporate browser problems as companies slowly migrate their internal tools off of legacy versions of Internet Explorer.

""The real key here is how and why multiple browsers wind up in the enterprise. That drives the need for Catalyst,"" he wrote in an instant message conversation today. ""It's a combination of IT needs, if they still have legacy versions of IE for legacy apps, and end user demand for the browser of their choice, usually Chrome or Firefox, given that IT can no longer keep end users from installing a second browser.""

(Credit: Browsium)

The rules can be deployed to end user employees from Windows' Active Directory or a third-party enterprise software distribution system. Once the employee navigates to a site governed by Catalyst, it automatically opens in the proper browser without any further interaction.

Because of how it works, Schare claimed Catalyst can minimize some security risks like zero-days. Companies can use it to force corporate intranets to open in a specific browser, he wrote, while allowing employees to use other browsers for Web work outside the intranet. This is similar to current security advice, which suggests running one browser for mission-critical use like banking transactions, and a second browser for general-purpose Web browsing.

Though the product is designed for corporate enterprise use, Schare said there's nothing stopping people at home from giving it a shot to control which browser opens high-use sites with sensitive information like Web-mail, banking, or shopping sites.

Schare said he expects the current public beta to finalize sometime in the first quarter of 2013. Browsium hasn't released any pricing information yet, either. However, Schare did say that the number of companies that have expressed interest in Catalyst is ""in the hundreds.""",html

Microsoft has opened the tap on its cloud-based Office 365 and is now offering the service as a public beta for anyone to try out.

Available in 38 countries and in 17 languages, the new beta follows several months of limited testing among a couple thousand businesses that were able to kick the tires on the service. After the public beta, Office 365 will officially launch later this year.

Unveiled last October, Office 365 is Microsoft's attempt to offer businesses a cloud-based alternative to some of its traditional desktop and server products. The service combines Office Web Apps with hosted versions of Exchange and SharePoint as well as Microsoft's Lync product, which provides the online communication and collaboration piece.

As such, Office 365 is designed to offer a gamut of features, including document creation and sharing, e-mail, IM, online meetings, and public Web sites. Microsoft is also including protection in the form of its enterprise ForeFront security client and is promising a 99.9 percent uptime for the entire service.

Once it officially launches, Office 365 will be offered as two different plans depending on the size of the company. Smaller businesses with 25 or fewer employees can pay $6 per person per month to receive Office Web Apps and the hosted versions of Exchange and SharePoint. Larger enterprises will have to choose one of four different plans at a cost of anywhere from $10 to $27 per person per month.

In addition to targeting the business world, Microsoft is reaching out to the educational market with five different plans geared toward faculty, staff, and students.

Also now available as a beta is the Office 365 Marketplace. Designed to supplement Office 365, the marketplace tries to help businesses find apps and services offered by different Microsoft partners.

CNET reporter Josh Lowensohn took Office 365 for a spin last November to evaluate the service's pros and cons. He found that everything worked as advertised, but that, as things stood at the time, ""Google Apps this is not.""",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-10424471-264.html,Firefox development dilemma: Tweak or overhaul?,,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Mozilla is building a number of features into the upcoming Firefox 3.7 browser--but the organization now has begun stewing over whether to introduce some of them in a significant update, as planned, or to rewrite some sooner for a variation of the current browser.

Programmer Benjamin Smedberg proposed the retrofit approach with a version called Lorentz on a Mozilla mailing list in late December. In the resulting discussion, developers and observers weighed the tactical advantages to each approach and wondered whether the quickening pace of Firefox development is ill-suited to browser users among businesses.

Firefox is based on a browser engine project called Gecko. The nearly complete (but somewhat tardy) Firefox 3.6 is built on Gecko 1.9.2, and Firefox 3.7 is set to use Gecko 1.9.3. The question afoot is whether to ""backport"" significant Gecko 1.9.3 features to 1.9.2 and release the new Lorentz version of Firefox based on it.

""With the [Lorentz] project branch, I believe we could go to beta in the middle of January and release in late March/early April,"" Smedberg said. In contrast, ""doing a release from Mozilla-Central/1.9.3 presents a lot of schedule risk without matching reward.""

One design change in question is the implementation of out-of-process plug-ins, which would move plug-ins such as Adobe Systems' Flash to a separate computing process--and a project in which Smedberg is involved. The work, the first phase of a Mozilla project called Electrolysis, is expected to improve stability; many browser crashes are the result of problems with Flash programs. Another feature he'd like is a less disruptive browser update process--a particularly relevant technology, given Mozilla's attempt to move to a more frequent release cycle.

Mozilla

Chris Blizzard, who runs Mozilla's developer relations, sounded supportive of the Lorentz plan in a mailing-list message. He added some features he'd like to implemented sooner rather than later, including faster Direct2D-based graphics for Windows machines, CSS transitions that can add pizazz to some graphic elements, and Web Sockets for communication between a browser and a server.

But, he added, delay is a risk of new features. ""We need to make sure this train doesn't get too big, though, or it will stretch out into a pretty long release,"" Blizzard said. Indeed, that's what happened with Firefox 3.5, which began as a quick 3.1 update but arrived months later, as more features were added.

Added L. David Baron, ""I have bad feelings about this plan, based on the last time we did this: Firefox 2.0 sucked resources away from the trunk [the development of new version of Gecko] and allowed it to become extremely unstable, and it look a long time to get things back together for Firefox 3.""

Eventually, the Mozilla mailing-list discussion turned to how well corporate users are able to deal with a fast development cycle.

""The nature of the Web doesn't really lend itself to long-lived stable browser branches, IMHO,"" programmer Robert O'Callahan said. ""A lot of the security issues we discover in the Web itself require proactive security measures such as UI [user interface] and architectural changes that one normally wouldn't apply to a 'stable branch.'""

John J. Barton, an IBM programmer involved with the Firebug extension to Firefox to aid Web developers, made the case for relatively rapid changes.

""IBM and our customers are all moving to faster development cycles,"" Barton wrote. ""That's why I urge [the] Firefox team to continue to lead in that direction.""",html

http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/windows-insider-builds-are-downloadable-again,Windows Insider builds are downloadable again,"November,Pm,Tom Mcnamara",2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"In the lead-up to Windows 10's release this summer, enterprising techies could download free preview builds of the operating system through Microsoft's Insider program. A new Windows OS for free was a pretty tempting carrot. However, Microsoft understandably shut off this spigot once Windows 10 was released, since it didn't want everyone to keep grabbing the test builds. Now that the dust has settled, Microsoft has turned the spigot back on, with one important change: the device you're installing the build on must already have an activated copy of Windows 10 associated with it.

Judging by Microsoft's wording -- ""You will need to install the Windows 10 Insider Preview build on a device that has been previously activated with Windows 10 or with a Windows 10 product key"" -- the device doesn't have to have Windows 10 on it when you install the Insider build on it. The device just needs to have had an activated copy of Windows 10 on it at some time, which would include previous Insider builds. So if you have Windows 10 or used to have an Insider build of the OS on your machine, you should be able to install these new builds, even on a blank drive.

Getting activated

As we've mentioned before, activation creates a unique fingerprint for your device that's stored in Microsoft's cloud, and it only needs to be done once. And under ordinary circumstances, this happens automatically during installation. Microsoft will then recognize the device by its fingerprint in the future to authorize further activations, if necessary.

If your device activated a copy of Windows 10 in the past, you can grab Insider builds from Microsoft's website. These are ISO files, which you can burn to a DVD or install on a USB stick using Microsoft's official Windows USB/DVD Download Tool. Be aware that using the USB tool will format your USB thumb drive, so make sure that you move all your important stuff to another location first.

Windows upgrades get an upgrade

In related news, Microsoft recently announced an upcoming change to the Get Windows 10 campaign (where qualifiying users of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 can upgrade to Windows 10 for free until July 29, 2016): You will be able to activate the upgrade with a Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 product key, rather than having to install the upgrade on top of Windows 7 or 8.1 first.

That means you can do a fresh install of Windows 10 on a formatted storage device and use one of your older keys to activate it. Just so we're clear, the Get Windows 10 version of Windows 10 is different from the Insider Build. Get Windows 10 delivers the retail version of Windows 10, while the Insider system is for beta testing versions of Windows before they reach the general public. The new version of Get Windows 10 should be available before the end of November.

Yelp (iOS, Android). Yelp's crowdsourced recommendations can guide you to a nearby PokeStop, where you can find items and -- if a Lure Module is running -- wild Pokemon. On the Web version of Yelp, a PokeStop Nearby filter helps you narrow your choices.

In the Yelp app, turn on the PokeStop Nearby filter to limit your search.

Poke Radar (iOS). A community-generated map, Poke Radar displays Pokemon locations discovered by Pokemon Go players. Through the app, players can submit found Pokemon, much like drivers can submit traffic and road information with Waze. The website version of the tool is often unavailable because of heavy traffic, but the app is probably more practical anyway for tracking down Pokemon. An iOS version is available now; the developers say an Android version is due any moment.

Nearby Pokemon. When working properly, Pokemon Go (iOS, Android) can help you track specific wild Pokemon. Tap the Nearby Pokemon box in the bottom-right corner of the map to see nearby Pokemon and their proximity, based on the number of pawprints displayed under each one (from none to three).

With the box open, you can also tap a Pokemon to select and track it. The Nearby Pokemon box should pulse when you are heading in the direction of the stalked Pokemon. However, the Nearby Pokemon tool can act erratically -- recently, it would only display Pokemon three pawprints away.

The distance each pawprints represents is also confusing, with users doing lots of field research on the subject. (For what it's worth, we tracked one three-pawprint Pokemon for a mile before it disappeared from the Nearby box, while we found another three-pawprint Pokemon just two and a half city blocks away.)

Spawns. A flutter of leaves or a rustle of grass appear to signal that you are near a Pokemon spawn point. Not that a wild Pokemon has spawned right then, but one may shortly.

Likewise, an active Lure Module will attract Pokemon to a PokeStop for 30 minutes. Users have reported that using an Incense item while a Lure Module is active has led to an increased Pokemon spawn rate.

We've noticed that concentrations of Pokemon Go users appear to drive up spawn rates, and Redditors report something similar. One Redditor, however, speculates that spawn rate is based on data usage, not number of users in an area.

August 3 update: Over the weekend, Niantic pushed out an update to Pokemon Go intended to address a few confusing aspects of the game. First, Niantic removed the three-step tracking display that was designed to help you hunt Pokemon but which many users found more confusing than helpful. It may return, as Niantic said it intends to improve the tool. Next, Niantic said it limited the ability of third-party developers to access the game, which directly affects location apps. The website PokeRadar, however, is still up and running. Pokemon forums lit up after the update, with many users speculating that with the update, the catch rate changed. A redditor wrote up a detailed post on capture rates and determined the rate hasn't changed in the update, although other factors, such as a Pokemon jumping or attacking, may affect how many balls you need to toss to capture a Pokemon. The post is worth checking out. Other changes include a reminder when you launch the game to not play Pokemon Go while driving and to not trespass while playing. One welcome addition: Trainers can now change the look of their avatar through their profile screen.

http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20096375-264/mozilla-puts-mobile-firefox-on-the-front-burner/,Mozilla puts mobile Firefox on the front burner,,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Mozilla is expanding development of Firefox for Android with new efforts to improve its performance, lower its power consumption, adapt it for tablets--and keep the browser maker relevant in the hottest area of computing.

Firefox is the second-most widely used browser on computers, but things are different in the mobile arena. There, Firefox is at a serious disadvantage compared to mobile browsers such as Apple's Safari and Google's unbranded Android browser that are built into the operating systems.

Mozilla, by comparison, must convince people or phone makers to install Firefox, and even then restrictions keep it off several mobile operating systems.

But Mozilla clearly has recognized that mobile computing is rapidly expanding beyond the niche of technophiles and wealthy folks who want a high-status phone. Firefox won't have an easy time carving a place for itself on new mobile devices, but Mozilla is doing its darndest to build a browser that will attract users.

One illustration: When Mozilla programmer Dave Mandelin began an active discussion about what Firefox needs to run better on ARM processors, which dominate the phone and tablet market, a broad, active discussion took off. Mandelin wasn't very gentle.

""If you have a powerful device, Firefox performance is in many ways pretty good. But UI [user interface] responsiveness and memory usage seem to be in pretty bad shape,"" Mandelin said. ""So we need to get better measurements and start improving performance in those areas, today.""

And Mozilla, barred from bringing its browser to major mobile operating systems such as Apple's iOS and Microsoft's Windows Phone, is moving beyond browsers, too.

""Smartphones and tablets are where the next billion people will expect their personalized experience to be available to them anytime, anywhere,"" Mozilla said in its vision statement that Mozilla Vice President of Products Jay Sullivan published earlier this year. ""To significantly affect Internet life in the future, we will have to deliver value on major OSes, whether we are allowed to ship our own browser engine or not.""

Getting a Fennec foothold

That operating system barrier has made it harder for Firefox for mobile, code-named Fennec, to gain a foothold.

The two initial operating systems for Fennec were Maemo from Nokia and Windows Mobile from Microsoft. Maemo became MeeGo when Nokia merged the effort with Intel's mobile Linux project, but through a major Nokia restructuring, MeeGo has been consigned to oblivion.

Microsoft, meanwhile, overhauled Windows Mobile 6.5 to produce Windows Phone 7--and one aspect of that shift is the removal of the software interfaces necessary to run Firefox.

Another possible avenue, Research in Motion's BlackBerry operating system, doesn't look promising, either. Although RIM started a closed beta test of a native developer kit (NDK) last week for BlackBerry tablets, the company told CNET in a statement that won't enable browsers such as Firefox, as it's currently engineered, on phones.

""We do not have any plans to bring an NDK to the BlackBerry OS today,"" the company said in a statement. ""It would have to be written in Java to run on our platform. Opera, Bolt, and other browsers have been ported to the BlackBerry smartphone platform to date.""

The fact that Firefox runs in part as a native code on a smartphone's hardware rather than on higher-level layer such as the Java-like interface of Android raises programming challenges. Mozilla has a long list of Android devices on which Firefox doesn't run.

With Apple barring any browser from iOS that doesn't use the operating system's own built-in WebKit engine, Android is far and away Firefox's biggest hope. Even there, though, Mozilla will have to persuade people to install and use Firefox.

To get try get ahead, Mozilla could follow in Opera's footsteps by getting companies to preinstall the browser. ""Mozilla is certainly interested in working with OEMs [original equipment manufacturers such as phone makers] and others who share our vision,"" the company said.

Such partners typically are more motivated by financial self-interest than Mozilla's vision of an open Web, though. And they'd have to be assured that customers wouldn't be confused, unhappy, or hampered by even more mobile browsing incompatibilities than they'd otherwise experience.

Pushing for Android

One measurement Mozilla is watching is feedback for Firefox on the Android Market. There, reviews are generally favorable with an average rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, but that trails the Dolphin Browser HD, Opera Mobile, and Opera Mini, all of which get 4.5 stars. For Firefox on Android, ""slow"" is a top complaint. Another is lack of support for Adobe Systems' Flash Player, a browser plug-in that's widely used on desktop computers but not on mobile devices.

Mozilla

Mozilla is tackling the problems, though--and it's bringing its six-week rapid-release development process, too, so changes should come steadily and frequently. The next version, Firefox 7 for mobile devices, brings a wealth of new interfaces for Web programmers and the ability to copy and paste text for users.

One area where people can expect improvement is power consumption to increase battery life. ""Mozilla is looking for both volunteers and potential paid employees who are experienced at measuring and tuning power usage on small devices,"" said Mozilla programmer Benjamin Smedberg in a blog post earlier this month.

Another area is user interface. Firefox for Android has gradually dovetailed better with Android's own interface, and a big priority now is to improve it for Android tablets.

Development speed is potentially a big advantage over Android's stock browser, which has moved comparatively slowly and, unlike Google's Gmail and Google Maps applications, hasn't been broken out of the operating system as an app that can be updated through the Anrdoid Market.

""Android WebKit is the closest thing to being the IE6 of mobile development for me,"" said Web developer and browser expert Dion Almaer in a blog post today, referring to the decade-old but still widely used version of Internet Explorer that Web programmers loathe. ""So many people are on old fragmented versions of Android, so you still have to support the old stuff which is ripe with issues that raise their nasty head at every turn.""

Firefox's cold start

Unfortunately for Mozilla, though, Firefox is at an inherent disadvantage compared to the stock Android browser because of the way the mobile operating system manages scarce memory.

When more memory is needed, idle applications get pushed out of active memory. But according to Firefox developer Mike Hommey, the WebKit browser engine used in Android's stock browser is essentially kept in memory by ""all Android appications,"" keeping it in active memory. When Firefox gets bumped out, loading a Web page requires reloading the browser into memory.

That ""cold start"" means Firefox users on Android are treated to the browser's splash screen while it loads into memory again, something that's begun to pain Michael Verdi, a support content manager at Mozilla.

""The vast majority of my interactions with a browser on my phone is following a link from e-mail, Twitter, Facebook, or any number of apps,"" Verdi said in a response to Mandelin. ""If Firefox has to cold start it's painful. And the thing is, it has to cold start all of the time. I can't tell you how many times a day I see that logo (6? 8?). It's making me start to hate the logo.""

Verdi posted a video (in WebM format) that shows how much slower Firefox is than the stock Android browser at loading a page--16.9 seconds vs. 7.5 seconds on his HTC Desire HD.

Mark Finkle proposed the idea of making sure Fennec purges as much data from its memory cache as possible so that the browser is less likely to be evicted from memory.

Bigger ambitious

Clearly, it's not a simple task bringing Firefox to the mobile market. The organization is trying another efforts that's arguably even more challenging: an entire mobile operating system.

Mozilla's Boot to Gecko project (B2G) aims to produce a mobile phone operating system that boots straight to a Web browser. That browser comes with enough programming interfaces to match what native mobile apps can do today--dialing the phone, for example.

Under the covers, it runs a stripped-down version of Android that's called Gonk. Apps, though, are Web apps, not those that run on Linux or Android's Java-esque environment.

Getting users or phone makers to adopt such software seems like it'll be an even harder challenge than getting them to adopt Firefox for Android. But Mozilla can be a healthy influence on the industry even when its products don't become dominant.

Opera has released its latest browser betas that emphasize speed improvements and better HTML5 compliance. Opera 10.60 for Windows, Mac, and Linux gives fans of the alternative Web browser a bucketload of HTML5-related improvements, along with the claim that the company has made the browser 50 percent faster than the previous version.

Opera 10.60 beta 1 should be 50 percent faster than the current stable Opera, version 10.53, when tested on the Peacekeeper test, an Opera representative said. CNET tests revealed a strong speed improvement, but not that strong. An average of three cold runs for Opera 10.53 scored 5,104, while Opera 10.60 beta 1 scored 6,792.67. (On Peacekeeper, higher is better.) That's a 33 percent increase, which is still impressive.

On the SunSpider JavaScript test, which Opera did not test against, CNET tests showed version 10.53 completing three cold runs in an average of 398.13 milliseconds. Version 10.60 beta 1 finished in 375.13 ms, or 5.6 percent faster.

The beta version also adds support for many nascent HTML5 features, including the next-generation video and audio codec WebM, geolocation compatibility, Web Workers and App Cache.

Opera made some slight interface tweaks in this beta version. Opera added search suggestions for several sites that it has partnerships with, such as Wikipedia. Also, it gave tabs custom thumbnails, too. You can read the full changelog for Opera 10.60 here.",html

Microsoft's Windows 10 is free for Windows 7 and 8.1 users, but people aren't exactly rushing to upgrade.

The latest version of the Windows software, released in late July, snagged a 9.96 percent share of all Web traffic generated by desktop operating systems in December, tracking company NetMarketShare said Friday. That's up from 9 percent in November, continuing a tepid pace for Windows 10 following an initial burst of energy in the first month after the software hit the market.

The report is in sharp contrast to Microsoft's upbeat announcement Monday that Windows 10 has seen an ""incredible response"" with more than 200 million devices worldwide running the software. That number includes tablets and smartphones, not just desktop PCs. The company also said that Windows 10 adoption is accelerating, with more than 40 percent of new Windows 10 devices having been activated since Black Friday in late November.

""Windows 10 continues to be on the fastest growth trajectory of any version of Windows -- ever -- outpacing Windows 7 by nearly 140 percent and Windows 8 by nearly 400 percent,"" Yusuf Mehdi, the head of Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group.

Still, there's a long way to go for the newest version of the world's most widely used PC operating system.

NetMarketShare noted that Windows 10 is within striking distance of Windows XP and Windows 8.1, which saw their Web traffic shares drop last month to 10.9 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively. But those declines can be explained in part by the fact that XP is no longer supported by Microsoft and that some 8.1 users are likely taking advantage of Microsoft's offer of a free upgrade to Windows 10.

A Microsoft spokeswoman said the company does not comment on third-party data.

The poky uptake of Windows 10 over the past five months comes as Microsoft tries to prove it can still make a compelling, user-friendly operating system after the washout of Windows 8, which alienated many with a radically new look and feel. Windows 10 is also designed to work across a variety of devices from PCs to tablets to mobile phones, so Microsoft is hoping its newest version of Windows can grab more users across its entire ecosystem.

Windows 7 scored a Web traffic share of 55 percent last month, according to NetMarketShare. That figure has changed little since December 2014 and is still enough to keep the software far ahead of the rest of the pack.

The software giant has aggressively been trying to coax people to shift to Windows 10, pushing the upgrade through frequent pop-up reminders for Windows 7 and 8.1 users. The company classified Windows 10 as an ""optional update"" last year. Microsoft expects to change that to ""recommended update"" early this year.

Microsoft is so keen to shift people to Windows 10 that one executive has begun striking a note of caution about Windows 7. ""Windows 10 is a much better place than Windows 7,"" Microsoft marketing chief Chris Capossela said last week on the Windows Weekly podcast.

""We do worry when people are running an operating system that's 10 years old that the next printer they buy isn't going to work well, or they buy a new game, they buy Fallout 4, a very popular game, and it doesn't work on a bunch of older machines,"" Capossela said, apparently referring to Windows 7, according to a transcript of the interview from BetaNews.

The comment is odd because Windows 7 is six years old and still seems healthy. Microsoft discontinued free support for Windows 7 a year ago, but paid support will continue to 2020. Bug fixes, patches and other updates will also keep rolling out until the end of this decade, ensuring that Windows 7 will remain protected against malware and other threats.

Update, 8:35 a.m. PT: Added information from Microsoft's Monday announcement, along with a statement from a Microsoft spokeswoman.",html

LAS VEGAS--Slacker Radio, a popular alternative to Pandora, announced a few valuable new partnerships here at CES, one of which should have sports fans foaming at the mouth.

Thanks to Slacker's new partnership with ESPN Audio, users can now listen to live streams of ESPN shows and sporting events on the Web through Slacker.com. And according to the company's representatives, the new live content will be coming to Slacker's mobile apps soon as well--though no date was given. While all Slacker listeners will get access to the interactive ESPN Radio station, the live programming will only be available to Slacker Radio Plus and Premium subscribers.

Also announced was Slacker's new partnership with The Weather Channel, which brings customizable national, regional, and local weather forecasts to Slacker listeners. The new feature is coming ""sometime in early 2012"" both on the Web and to mobile devices.

Finally, American Public Media has also partnered with Slacker to bring popular public radio programming to the fast-growing Internet radio service. APM's Marketplace gives Slacker a new source of business and economic news programs while The Current brings a non-commercial Triple A music station into the fold.

Slacker appears to be beefing up its catalog of content, which should fuel what will likely be an exciting year of showdowns between all of the competing streaming media services.",html

Terry Myerson, executive vice president of the Windows and Devices Group, laid out the company's game plan, based on two principles: (1) ""Windows 10 collects information so the product will work better for you,"" and (2) ""You are in control with the ability to determine what information is collected."" Myerson adds that all such data is encrypted when sent to Microsoft and is stored in secure facilities.

Myerson's blog post was likely prompted by recent discoveries that Windows 10 can send usage information to Microsoft, even when all such communication tools appeared to have been shut down by the user. As initially reported by Ars Technica, activities like clicking the Start menu button can trigger communication between your computer and Microsoft.

According to Myerson, one reason to leave certain things enabled is to help improve device drivers, which act as the communication layer between Windows and the physical components of your computer, tablet, or phone. He cites one example of a video card causing persistent system crashes, which Microsoft was able to fix within 48 hours, because the user data collection in Windows 10 was making the company aware of the problem.

Myerson does not address the utility of employing user feedback instead of background data collection, which had been in the system in place until now. He does emphasize that personally identifiable information is not collected. Microsoft acquires ""anonymous device ID, device type, and application crash data."" He adds that Microsoft does not scan your email or the contents of your file, ""unlike some other platforms"" (presumably a reference to Gmail scanning your email for keywords to refine its advertisements). However, the claim that the competition may be doing something worse has historically been a challenging method for making a case for your own product.

In a separate statement, Microsoft announced that it was working on a future update of the enterprise edition of Windows 10 to allow users to disable all unsolicited communication with Microsoft.

We've covered the long list of privacy settings that Windows 10 users have to pore over, and you'll probably want to take a look at your Windows 10 security settings as well.

Published by the Mountain View-based AnchorFree, Inc., Hotspot Shield (download for Windows or Mac) claims to be the world's largest Virtual Private Network (VPN) with more than 10 million users. The Elite version gives upgraders multiple ad-free payment methods and plans, and offers site-load times that are ""up to 100 percent faster"" than the standard flavor of Hotspot Shield.

(Credit: AnchorFree)

A version of Hotspot Shield that uses servers based in the United Kingdom, called Expat Shield (download), remains ad-supported only.

David Gorodyansky, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of AnchorFree, told CNET earlier this month that the two programs attract 9 to 10 million unique monthly users, who create 40 million user sessions per month, and generate more than 2 billion pageviews per month. ""Essentially we're an Akamai, we're a content delivery network,"" David Gorodyansky, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of AnchorFree, told CNET earlier this month. ""It makes sense to have both a secured computer, with antivirus, and a secured connection, with Hotspot Shield,"" he added.

The browser-independent Hotspot Shield establishes an encrypted connection to the Hotspot Shield servers, and turns all HTTP traffic to the safer HTTPS. By re-routing Web traffic and providing you with a new IP address hosted by AnchorFree, the company is able to ensure that your data isn't plucked out of the open by man-in-the-middle attacks or wireless network spoofing.

Gorodyansky said he is keenly aware of the implications of being a globally-available anonymizing service. ""People use us to bypass censorship,"" he said with a smile, and explained that's why the Elite version offer multiple payment systems. Elite will be sold for $0.50 per 24 hour session, with a minimum $10 deposit, or $5 per month, or $45 per year. Payment options include credit card, PayPal, prepaid cash cards or mobile phone payments via premium SMS.

The free version is monetized by an ad platform served through the VPN. When the user activates Hotspot Shield or Expat Shield, a start page comes up that serves the ads. There's also a 720 pixel by 98 pixel toolbar ad, but neither runs when the Shield hasn't been activated. So, you can browse the Web with the Shield installed, but not running. Both the ad-supported version and Elite offer unlimited bandwidth with no restrictions.

The company has created multiple ways to circumvent download blockers in countries with strict censorship, too. If you can't access a Web page with the download, you can send an e-mail to win@anchorfree.com for the Windows version or mac@anchorfree.com for the Mac version, and the small installer file will be sent directly to you.

During a day of hands-on testing on the notoriously pokey CNET public Wi-Fi network, I noticed that Hotspot Shield Elite was remarkably fast. There were no connection lags despite the re-routing, and the program admirably handled high-definition streaming videos from sites such as Vimeo, YouTube, and CNET TV. I'd recommend the program for improving the Wi-Fi speeds alone, nevermind the additional security benefits.

Aside from Hotspot Shield Elite's preferential bandwidth priority and lack of ads, there are no built-in additional features in Elite. However, AnchorFree has arranged a deal with Skype so that new Elite users get two hours of Skype talk time free when signing up. In addition to plans for an Elite version of Expat Shield, Gorodyansky said that the company plans to build a mobile app for Hotspot Shield.",html

Firefox for Mobile (download) is just one step away from its first Android release, as Mozilla announced the browser's release candidate today.

Pending final testing, the mobile version of the popular Firefox browser will soon be available in full force on Android smartphones (the release candidate will be available beginning today in the Android Market). Firefox 4 will also work on the Maemo platform (download).

I sat down with Mozilla to take a look at the upcoming changes and enhancements. I've always liked Mozilla's mobile design, which hides the nuts and bolts like settings and tabs in the ""gutters"" on either side of the browsing screen and can be reached by swiping right or left. The layout does expand the screen's real estate, but it also makes some features harder to access.

A new default start screen puts some of those features back into focus with quick links to previously viewed Web pages, suggested Firefox add-ons, and most-recent tabs you've opened on other computers, the latter courtesy of Firefox Sync.

The awesome bar--the combined address and search fields--has also received a little more awesomeness; it now pulls down as a screen to reveal your bookmarks, browsing history, and desktop tabs from Sync. Typing a few letters pulls up suggestions.

In terms of usability, however, I was most impressed with improvements made to the browser's speed. Mozilla takes a risk releasing nightly and in-production builds, and Firefox in the past has not had the performance capabilities that the browser needs to be competitive. It can have all the cool and useful add-ons it wants, but if it's not fast, nobody will use it. Mozilla knows it, and the browsing speeds during our demo were heartening. We'll have more detailed benchmarks when the full release hits.

In addition to smoother, faster browsing, I played with pinch and zoom and a new, yet very familiar fit-to-zoom gesture wherein double-tapping the screen zooms the content in to a full-width column. It's an easy way to focus in on one article on a Web site's splash page, for example.

Copy/paste is an option for text fields, but not yet for content within a Web site. Hopefully that's a technical conundrum that Mozilla will be able to tackle in future versions.

Firefox 4 for Android and Maemo will work on tablets as well as smartphones. On the technical side, it runs off the same engine (Gecko 2.0) driving the desktop version of Firefox 4, which is also due this week, and it supports HTML5.

Again, this is the release candidate and not the full version, though we expect the full version to follow very soon.",html

The robust Norton Internet Security 2012 (download) and slimmer Norton AntiVirus 2012 (download) introduce several new features and reasonable but not amazing performance bumps.

There's now a link at the bottom of the main interface to Norton's mobile version. Next to it is a link for Norton Management, a new tool which opens in your default Web browser that allows you to use Norton remotely. This includes monitoring security status, remote add and installation, and license key renewal. However, given the growth of the mobile market, it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect a stronger connection between the two in the coming year.

One of the better new features is a change to Download Insight. This community-driven tool originally evaluated files being downloaded for security, but now it looks at their stability among other Norton users, too. There's also metered bandwidth options for people on rate-limited connections, and several interface tweaks to make the program easier on the eyes and easier to find things.

Most of the bigger improvements this time around come only to Norton Internet Security, in an attempt to up its usefulness with a bulkier feature set. One is the port of Norton 360's startup manager. If you're Windows savvy, you're probably comfortable handling that stuff by hand, but even for those in the know the Norton version makes startup changes easier to implement. Along with pulling in community ratings, you can toggle a process on or off, or delay it.

The Identity Safe has been improved, too. It now includes LastPass-styled password handling and cloud-based syncing and vaults, features that some competitors have had for a while. Google Chrome finally gets Safe Web support from Norton, but it's surprisingly not in Norton AntiVirus. While I understand the point of value-added features, this one seems an unnecessarily restrictive hit on users of the fastest-growing browser.

Fortunately, none of these changes appear to have impacted the hit on system performance. CNET Labs determined that both Norton Internet Security and Norton AntiVirus perform about the same. Independent, third-party testing organizations have also made the call that Norton continues to be one of the most effective security suites on the market.

Overall, Norton 2012 continues the ""new"" approach Symantec has had for the past four years, with top-shelf features and performance. And yet, it's still likely that, despite the enormous positive changes to the suite, that tough competition and prior negative reputation will continue to hinder its attempts to convince people that the leopard can change its spots.",html

Most of the Android smartphones on the market are susceptible to an attack in which someone could access calendar and contact data over an unencrypted Wi-Fi network, a team of German researchers said in a new report.

The problem is fixed in the latest version of Android, but 99.7 percent of all Android devices are running older versions, they said. Attacks can be carried out over unencrypted Wi-Fi hot spots by an attacker sniffing an authentication token (authToken) used by the Android devices when they communicate with the Google services, according to ""Catching AuthTokens in the Wild: The Insecurity of Google's ClientLogin Protocol,"" which was released Friday.

It is ""quite easy"" to launch an impersonation attack against Google Calendar, Contacts, and Picasa Web albums on newer Androids, and theoretically all Google services using the ClientLogin authentication protocol for access to its data APIs (application programming interfaces), the report said.

A Google representative confirmed that the latest version of Android, 2.3.4 for smartphones, and 3.0 for tablets does not have the problem. ""We're aware of this issue, have already fixed it for calendar and contacts in the latest versions of Android, and we're working on fixing it in Picasa,"" he said in an e-mail statement.

Here's how it works. With the ClientLogin Protocol, applications request an authToken from the Google service by sending an account name and password via an HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol secure) connection. The authToken is valid for up to two weeks and is used for subsequent requests to the Google service API. If the authToken is sent over unencrypted HTTP, an attacker could use network sniffing software, like Wireshark, to grab it, the researchers said.

""For instance, the adversary can gain full access to the calendar, contacts information, or private Web albums of the respective Google user,"" they wrote. ""This means that the adversary can view, modify, or delete any contacts, calendar events, or private pictures. This is not limited to items currently being synced but affects all items of that user.""

An attacker could grab multiple authTokens by setting up a Wi-Fi access point with the same name of a common wireless network provider, such as T-Mobile, Starbucks, or AT&T Wi-Fi and wait for Android phones with default settings to automatically connect to a previously known network and start syncing immediately, according to the report. Syncing would fail, but the attacker could capture authTokens for each service that attempted to sync.

Not only does this expose Calendar data, but also exposes information about users' contacts. An attacker also could change the stored e-mail addresses of contacts and the Google user would be at risk then of inadvertently sending sensitive information to the attacker instead of the intended recipient, the researchers noted.

""We tested this attack with Android versions 2.1 (Nexus One), 2.2 (HTC Desire, Nexus One), 2.2.1 (HTC Incredible S), 2.3.3 (Nexus One), 2.3.4 (HTC Desire, Nexus One), and 3.0 (Motorola XOOM) and with the native Google Calendar, Google Contacts, and Gallery apps (or respective synchronization services),"" the report said.

Google

Calendar and Contacts apps transmit requests in clear text via HTTP up to Android 2.3.3 and are therefore vulnerable to this type of attack. Since Android 2.3, the Gallery app provides Picasa Web Albums synchronization, which is also not encrypted, the researchers said. In Android 2.3.4 the Calendar and Contacts apps began using an HTTPS connection, however the Picasa sync does not, they said.

Android users should update to Android 2.3.4 as soon as possible. ""However, depending on your phone vendor you may have to wait weeks/months before an update is available for your phone,"" the researchers wrote.

Also, Android users should switch off automatic synchronization in the settings menu when connecting with open Wi-Fi networks and avoid using open Wi-Fi networks at all when using the apps.

Service Pack 1 was released to manufacturers earlier this month, with the announcement that it would arrive in consumers' hands this week. The software is set to hit Windows Update later today, with it already being posted as a 1.95GB download bundle for all versions on Microsoft's Download Center. TechNet subscribers and Microsoft volume license customers got access to the update last week.

Microsoft says the standalone update package should weigh in at 527MB for x86 users, about 903MB for x64 users, and 511MB for users on Itanium chips. In Windows Update, the download sizes are much smaller:

The service pack doesn't bring any new whiz-bang features for consumers, but it includes two important back end additions that promise to improve performance in Windows 7's server counterpart, Windows Server 2008 R2. The update adds Dynamic Memory and RemoteFX, technologies that increase, respectively, the density of virtual machines and the graphical prowess of thin-client hardware (more on those here). The RemoteFX feature is also coming to the consumer version of Windows 7 in the form of client-side support.

Also included in SP1 are a number of fixes for bugs and security holes, which may be useful for those who don't use the auto-update feature or are applying the update to machines that don't have an active Internet connection. Other small changes include improved HDMI audio-device performance, a fix for printing mixed-orientation XPS documents, and ""improved support"" for Advanced Format storage devices.

Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, Google Chrome beta 6.0.472.33 introduces to the beta build users many features that have been available to the developer's build users including changes to the interface, synchronization improvements, and a faster version of Google's V8 JavaScript engine.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Users familiar with Google Chrome dev (Windows | Mac | Linux) will find the beta lacking mostly minor and under-the--hood changes from the developer's build, although users can expect that to change as new features migrate from the bleeding-edge Chrome Canary build into the developer's version. However, the built-in PDF reader plug-in that currently ships in the developer's build is not present in the beta.

The new beta does include the form autofill feature, and autofill synchronization. Google said in a blog post announcing the beta that it will not insert the form data without user confirmation. This includes credit card data, which will explicitly prompt users to fill in that data in addition to the regular autofill prompt. Extensions in the beta are now synchronized, too, along with bookmarks and user settings. Interface changes include detaching the stop-refresh button from the location bar and giving it its own button on the left side of the interface, and merging the options menu to create more space for extension icons on the right side.

In the same blog post, Google touts the update to the V8 JavaScript engine in the new beta as being 15 percent faster than the stable build on its own V8 and SunSpider benchmarks, and 64 percent faster on Mozilla's Dromaeo DOM core benchmark.

And Foursquare, and Twitter, and Instagram. I use all of them on my iPhone. And I'm intrigued by Roamz, a new iPhone application that weaves updates and photos from all of them into one stream about what's going on in your immediate vicinity.

Harry McCracken/CNET

The app, which debuted at the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco last week, was created by a startup based in Sydney, Australia. It detects your location and displays items from the aforementioned services that have been geotagged as having happened nearby. It also includes its own feature for sharing updates and photos relating to your activities.

While Roamz certainly feels social, it's not a social network per se. You can connect it to your Facebook, Foursquare, and Twitter accounts, but it shows stuff from everyone who's shared it publicly, not just your friends. You also can't friend or follow other Roamz members, at least yet. It's about neighborhoods and the things going on in them, not specific people.

At first, I thought Roamz would be most useful as a practical guide to things I might want to do in a particular area. Instead, what I like about it is how it summarizes the disparate establishments that make up a neighborhood, from restaurants and bars to beauty parlors and art schools and including both ones I know about already and ones I'd never pay attention to otherwise. The local color can be fascinating. (If you simply don't care about a particular type of business, such as ""Travel & Lodging,"" you can turn it off, although I found that Roamz doesn't always categorize places accurately.)

So far, the app has a fairly sparse feel, at least in the areas I've been when I've checked it out. (When I tried it during Web 2.0 at the Palace Hotel in downtown San Francisco, it delivered more content than it does when I use it at my home in a sleepy Bay Area suburb, but it still wasn't teeming with activity.) And it isn't a source of up-to-the-moment information: The areas I've visited have been dominated by items from days or weeks ago.

Still, I'm having fun with Roamz and think the idea is full of potential. If it gets meatier and faster, it could be one of the first apps I turn to when I'm out and about.",html

http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-57391170-12/dont-get-faked-by-android-antivirus-apps/,Don't get faked by Android antivirus apps,"March,Am,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Updated Thursday, March 15, 2012, at 5:05 p.m. PDT: After complaints from some security app makers, AV-Test.org has published an updated report that raised scores for some apps.

If you're worried about Android malware, choose wisely. There's a good chance that your trusted security app does little to protect you, says a new report from independent testing organization AV-Test.

In a preview of the study e-mailed yesterday, AV-Test's CEO Andreas Marx revealed that desktop antivirus vendors that have migrated to Android performed the best. Avast, Lookout, Dr. Web, Zoner, F-Secure, Ikarus, and Kaspersky detected 90 percent or more of the 618 types of malicious Android APK files that they were tested against. Lookout and Zoner are notable standouts because they are only available as mobile apps, and have no PC-based counterpart.

""Using these products you don't have to worry about your malware protection,"" wrote Marx. He also emphasized that the security apps that tested between 65 percent and 90 percent were very good and could easily improve their detection because several apps in this category missed one or two malware families. These malware families may not be threats in ""certain environments,"" he wrote, which may account for the lower scores.

The apps in this second group include the PC antivirus vendors AVG, Bitdefender, ESET, Norton (Symantec,) QuickHeal, Trend Micro, Vipre (GFI,) and Webroot; and two mobile-only vendors, AegisLab and SuperSecurity.

A third group comprised entirely of PC security suite vendors scored between 40 and 65 percent detections, and included Bullguard, Comodo, G Data, McAfee, NetQin and Total Defense. The report explains that their Android woes might also be due to insufficient sample collection infrastructure--basically, they might be too new to the field.

Twelve more apps detected more than zero percent but less than 40 percent of the samples, and a final group of six apps detected nothing at all. While the report hedges its bet and says that its possible that the apps detect threats that weren't among the 618 samples, it's more likely that they simply do not work at all. Alphabetically, these final six are Android Antivirus, Android Defender, LabMSF Antivirus beta, MobileBot Antivirus, MT Antivirus, and MYAndroid Protection Antivirus.

Overall, less than half of the 41 apps tested during February were found worthy; only 17 made the cut above 65 percent. The test was conducted using a combination of the Android SDK, which replicates a scalable environment, and an actual Android device for when the SDK wouldn't work. The SDK would not suffice when the app called for SMS activation, or when the 3G network was too finicky to provide a stable cloud connection. The end result was that all results were cross-checked in the SDK, emulating API level 10 (Gingerbread 2.3,) and on a real device, a Samsung Galaxy Tab running Froyo 2.2 and a Samsung Galaxy Nexus with Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0. Apps were allowed to update to their latest versions before testing, and to connect to the cloud during testing.

The authors state in the report how challenging it is to correctly identify active, threatening malware on Android. In the report, they chalk this up to three factors: the relatively small number of malware samples; the challenge in figuring out how prevalent malware apps are; and the fact that, problems aside, malware apps are removed fairly rapidly from the Android Market and the even the user's own device.

Also, none of the ancillary security features were tested, such as remote lock and wipe, lost or stolen device location options, or data backup.

AV-Test concludes that it's possible to have sample sets that are easily marred by malware that is no longer or never has been relevant. Why even bother testing if the results are so hard to replicate? The report explains that to limit the problems of these variables, only the most widely known malware families were used, and only those discovered between August and December 2011. By looking at the family detection rates, AV-Test says, ""it is still possible to get a fairly accurate picture of the absolute detection rate."" For malware detection, AV-Test recommends any of the 17 apps that finished above 65 percent. It advocates using one because of the ability for ostensibly benign apps to download malware after they've been installed.

All these problems are symptomatic of the larger challenge that the security industry has in justifying its existence",html
https://www.cnet.com/news/uber-updates-privacy-policy-but-can-still-track-users,"Uber updates privacy policy, but can still track users",,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Uber

After coming under fire for questionable privacy practices, Uber announced Thursday it's updated its privacy policies to make them simpler and ""easier to understand.""

Uber, which pairs drivers with passengers via a smartphone app, was blasted in the press last fall for boasting it could track a reporter without her knowledge using a feature called ""God View."" With the resulting backlash, the company announced it had hired a third-party data-privacy expert to review its policies and provide recommendations. And now we're seeing the results of that intervention.

The new privacy policies ""explain more clearly and concisely what data Uber asks for, and how that data is used to provide or improve our services,"" Uber's managing counsel of data privacy, Katherine Tassi, wrote in a blog post Thursday. ""Users will be in control: they will be able to choose whether to share the data with Uber.""

Since Uber was founded in 2009, it's gone from operating just in San Francisco to being in hundreds of cities in 57 countries. With that fast growth, Uber has become the target of criticism for things like drivers allegedly assaulting passengers, the company reportedly partaking in unfair competition with rivals, and the whole God View debacle. Uber is now trying to show it's a company passengers can trust.

Uber hired well-known data privacy expert Harriet Pearson and her law firm Hogan Lovells in November. One of the firm's recommendations for Uber was to simplify its policies. So the ride-hailing company has now cut its privacy statements in half, Tassi said. Uber spells out when it needs users' location data, such as when it's connecting drivers with passengers, and when it uses riders' contact details, like when users want to split their fare with another passenger.

Tassi also mentioned that when users agree to the company's privacy policies, they consent to Uber accessing their location data even when they're not actively using the app for a ride. Also, the ride-hailing company says it may tap into users' contact lists for ""promotional"" offers.

""These changes would allow Uber to ask for access to a rider's location when the app is running in the background and get people on their way more quickly,"" Tassi wrote. ""In addition, these changes would allow Uber to launch new promotional features that use contacts -- for example the ability to send special offers to riders' friends or family.""

Uber's new privacy statements go into effect July 15. Users don't need to do anything to agree to the new terms. Uber says continuing to use the app ""on or after"" that date will show the company that they've ""acknowledged and consented"" to the new policies.",html

But if you want added features like a tabbed interface, search and replace functionality, or extras that help you with coding projects, you need to look for the more full-featured alternatives. The best editors come with numerous features and work great for editing code for Web sites, but also for simply writing quick notes, and pasting excerpts from the Web when aggregating research for a project.

Fortunately, some of the best software in this category is free, but you can also use ""Light"" versions of paid software and still get most of the useful features.

NoteTab Light offers a tabbed interface and adds several libraries of premade code bits called ""clips"" you can access through a pull-down menu on the left side of the interface. These clips can be anything from commonly used code to quick formatting tools available at a click of your mouse. You can also quickly preview your work in your default Web browser from within the interface. NoteTab Light offers a lightweight footprint and is a huge upgrade from the Notepad included with Windows.

TextPad is another excellent text editor with a ""light"" version that most users will find offers plenty of features. Like NoteTab, TextPad offers a host of features like a tabbed-interface, and helpful formatting tools for indenting, line numbering, character transposing, and condition-based word wrapping. TextPad will bug you with a nag screen periodically, but most features are available even in this time-unlimited ""light"" version.

EditPlus is a text editing tool that's popular with a lot of people because of its ability to use simple FTP commands to get your files online from within the program. Powerful features for Web authors like a built-in Web browser for previews and syntax highlighting for HTML, CSS, PHP, ASP, Perl, C/C++, and many more make this program an excellent alternative. Added handy features like a Windows Explorer-like file directory built-in to the interface and a wealth of commonly used code clips (like NoteTab Light) make this software particularly appealing. EditPlus is a 30-day trial, but with all of its useful features, the $35 price tag is more than worth it.

Notepad++ is a popular choice among serious code crunchers because it's loaded with useful features and it's completely free. It supports several programming languages, offers syntax highlighting, drag-and-drop functionality, and you can easily launch a preview in IE or Firefox from within the software. As a free option, anybody wanting to see what it's like using a text editor even if it is for making lists or doing Web research has nothing to lose with this excellent text editor. But the popularity of this software among serious coders is definitely warranted, with more than enough features for most projects.",html

The latest update includes the power to do more than protect the mere output of your work: you can now encrypt and hide an entire operating system using the program's wizard.

(Credit: CNET Networks)

As the step-by-step guide points out when you start it, one of the reasons you might want to create a hidden OS is in case of extortion. A little paranoia doesn't hurt, either. So, when you create the hidden OS, it also creates signposts to a decoy hidden operating system. The decoy operating system is the only one an outside investigator can discover, since all indicators to the true hidden OS have been removed.

The reason that the decoy is needed is that to boot any system encrypted by TrueCrypt, the hard drive must have the unencrypted TrueCrypt boot loader installed. However, this new version of the program creates the ability for a single boot loader to support more than one encrypted partition. Because the mere existence of the boot loader indicates an encrypted system, the first encrypted volume becomes the dummy one. With no signposts to indicate the second encrypted volume exists, it becomes the hidden one.

The language in TrueCrypt's explanation of how this all works can be a little confusing, but basically the encrypted partition contains two volumes encrypted under different keys, one within the other. The interior volume contains the hidden OS, while the outer one has data that looks sensitive but you're willing to sacrifice to protect the existence of the hidden volume and its operating system.

Here's how it works. The wizard verifies that the necessary partitions exist, with the second one being at least five percent larger than the first. (That number jumps to 110 percent if you're running an NTFS volume.) Assuming you've already partitioned your hard drive, it creates two volumes behind the system partition--an outer one and the hidden one. Eventually, the OS you started the wizard under will become the decoy, but to start you need to copy that handful of super secret-looking files or folders over to the new, second partition.

TrueCrypt then reanalyzes the partition to determine the amount of space needed for the hidden OS, creates the hidden volume, and copies the content of the system partition to it. The process can be interrupted so that users can shut down or reboot their computers. This is important because, TrueCrypt warns, depending on volume size and your computer's performance, the whole process can take anywhere from hours to days.

Yeah, days.

(Credit: TrueCrypt)

The actual copying process will restart, though, if it's interrupted. Still, once it's done, TrueCrypt encrypts the operating system on the first partition, using a different encryption key from the one used to create the hidden OS.

To get started, go to the Menubar and click System, then choose Create Hidden Operating System. The wizard for this option is well detailed, with clear explanations helping you understand what you're doing at each step.

Somebody forcing you to disclose secure files will only find a handful that you've chosen because they look important. These files live on the decoy OS. The wizard creates a new partition and copies the entire OS that exists on the current partition to it. This new partition becomes the hidden OS. In total, users will have three passwords: one for the outer volume, one for the decoy operating system, and one that will allow the hidden operating system to boot.

TrueCrypt is so concerned with your security that it even provides examples of plausible deniability for you to use if your encryption scheme is ever discovered. Given all the recent news about personal data and top-secret government files getting stolen, one would think that companies and the feds would consider investing in TrueCrypt--but it seems like authentic security will have to be left to the casual power user instead.",html

The offline mode would be coming to Android shortly, according to Rita Chen, product manager of Google Maps for mobile.

The introduction of the new mapping service comes just as Apple is widely expected to drop Google's mapping application from iOS in favor of its own proprietary version. Maps is emerging as the next major battleground for technology companies, with services, recommendations, and advertisements built around location.

The service would work whether the phone was abroad and without access to a network, or in a subway station with no reception, Chen said. Despite the lack of a connection, a device with GPS would still allow a blue dot to track the location on the map. Likewise, the compass would also work if the device has the feature enabled.

The moves are part of a broader battle between Google and Apple over the ownership of mobile customers.

Apple is expected to drop Google Maps from iOS as soon as next week, when it holds its Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco. Google Maps has been a core part of the iPhone since its debut in 2007.

Maps mean big business for both Google and Apple. A large chunk of mobile revenue comes from ads that are related to its map services, such as recommendations based on location and local searches.",html

Mac users are certainly a growing breed, and this year's list shows what those users want in downloadable software: home music production, file conversion for iPhones and other mobile devices, video transfers from YouTube, and a simple video player that handles all formats. Read on to see which apps were the most popular Mac titles for 2010, and learn which honorable mention software just missed the list.

No. 10: All2MP3

Quick, reliable, and free are three adjectives most Download.com users love. The popularity of All2MP3 shows that Mac fans may like drag-and-drop MP3 conversion even more. A simple-as-pie graphical interface lets users drag files onto the All2MP3 interface and get instant MP3 conversions. Though it doesn't handle M4A files, it does convert the rest of the major file formats, and also provides some tweakable settings under the hood...if you can find them.

All2MP3 received 214,819 downloads in 2010, making it the 10th most popular Mac software on CNET Download.com.

No. 9: ManyCam Virtual Webcam

What fun is video chat without fake mustaches and party hats? In case your costume collection is stashed in the attic, ManyCam Virtual Webcam provides scads of digital dress-up opportunities, as well as background animations and text effects. You can also broadcast your Webcam simultaneously on MSN Messenger, Yahoo, Skype, AIM, PalTalk, and CamFrog. When used in conjunction with programs like iChat and Photobooth, you can access your ManyCam settings directly from those programs' effects lists.

ManyCam Virtual Webcam received 247,518 downloads in 2010, making it the ninth most popular Mac software on CNET Download.com.

No. 8: Mozilla Firefox

Apple's Safari is the default browser for Mac OS, but the open-source powerhouse Mozilla Firefox is the Web browser that Download.com users choose to put on their machines. Netscape begot the Mozilla suite; the Mozilla suite begot Firebird; and, in 2004, Firebird morphed into Mozilla Firefox, which has slowly but surely gained more users every year. The rise of competition means that Firefox is no longer fastest, but fantastic extensions and general reliability across all Web sites keep it on top of the list for Download.com Mac users.

Mozilla Firefox received 258,087 downloads in 2010, making it the eighth most popular Mac software on CNET Download.com.

No. 7: TeamViewer

This free screen-sharing program made big waves this year, vaulting up the Most Popular list for both Mac and Windows software. In fact, TeamViewer is the only application to make both Mac and Windows top-10 lists for 2010. Free and easy for even those who aren't computer-savvy to use, TeamViewer lets you quickly show or share your screen, as well as transfer files privately or set up a virtual private network (VPN). Secure and encrypted data eases privacy concerns, and the remote-desktop feature even lets you check your Mac at home while you're on the road.

TeamViewer received 277,716 downloads in 2010, making it the seventh most popular Mac software on CNET Download.com.

No. 6: RAR Expander

Mac OS can do a lot of things, but one thing it can't do by default is decompress RAR files. The RAR format is a proprietary system developed by engineer Eugene Roshal. It has gained fans through the years because of its high compression ratios, particularly for multimedia files like images and video. Though RAR archives can only be created with the WinRAR software, lots of products decompress RARs, and RAR Expander has leveraged its simple interface into a top-10 Mac download for 2010.

RAR Expander, received 343,251 downloads in 2010, making it the sixth most popular Mac software on CNET Download.com.

No. 5: StuffIt Expander

For Mac users who need more than simple RAR extraction, this longtime compression tool is the first pick on Download.com. The freeware app Stuffit Expander was forked from the longtime archiving tool Stuffit back in the early 1990s. Stuffit Expander only decompresses archives, but it can handle all sorts of them, including WinZip, WinRAR, 7-Zip, 7zX, iShrink, SimplyRAR, Rarify, Rucksack, iArchiver, BetterZip, and RarMachine. The 2011 versions of Stuffit Expander added a universal 32-bit/64-bit installer, e-mail notifications, and compatibility with the latest versions of Stuffit and Stuffit Deluxe.

StuffIt Expander received 353,042 downloads in 2010, making it the fifth most popular Mac software on CNET Download.com.

No. 4: YouTube Downloader+

Mac and Windows users might not agree on much, but both are certainly looking for an easy way to get videos from YouTube. Much like its similarly named counterpart on the Windows side, YouTube Downloader+ lets users transfer videos from the popular site to their local drives. Written in Java, the free utility lacks the polish and pizazz of most Mac software, but simplicity--paste in a YouTube URL and hit return to save a local FLV file--and name recognition keep it at the top of the heap.

YouTube Downloader+ received 409,362 downloads in 2010, making it the fourth most popular Mac software on CNET Download.com.

No. 3: Adobe Photoshop update

Despite some recent antagonism between Apple and Adobe, the two companies and their users have had a long relationship that isn't ending anytime soon. At the opposite end of the spectrum from YouTube Downloader+, Adobe Photoshop is a highly polished, full-featured image-editing application that has been generally considered best in its class for decades now. It also currently retails at $649. This update for the popular app keeps Mac users up-to-date with the latest changes from Adobe.

The Adobe Photoshop update received 423,964 downloads in 2010, making it the third most popular Mac software on CNET Download.com.

No. 2: VLC Media Player

An honorable mention on the Windows list, VLC Media Player makes a much bigger splash in Mac software, competing for the No. 1 spot in the Most Popular list for much of 2010. Highly portable, VLC also covers a wide range of video and audio formats, including MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, DivX, MP3, OGG, DVD, VCD, and a variety of streaming protocols. Recent versions even make it possible for users to record live video.

VLC Media Player received 591,698 downloads in 2010, making it the second most popular Mac software on CNET Download.com.

No. 1: Virtual DJ

Mac users have traditionally been known (stereotyped?) as ""creative types,"" so perhaps it's no surprise this bedroom music-production software reigns as king of the Mac mountain for 2010. A spin-off from the original AtomixMP3 mixing software, Virtual DJ has been assisting new and veteran DJs since 2003. Its newbie-friendly BeatLock engine keeps tracks automatically in sync, and automated seamless loops allow for impressive live-performance support. Virtual vinyl controls even let users scratch as if on a real turntable.

Virtual DJ received 774,287 downloads in 2010, making it the most popular Mac software on CNET Download.com.

https://www.cnet.com/news/researcher-finds-mother-of-all-android-vulnerabilities/,"Most Android phones at risk from simple text hack, researcher says",,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Zimperium

A security research company claims to have found a vulnerability baked into Android that could endanger nearly all devices running the popular mobile software.

The flaw, says researcher Zimperium, exists in the media playback tool built into Android, called Stagefright. Malicious hackers could take advantage of it by sending to an Android device a simple text message that, once received by the smartphone, would give them complete control over the handset and allow them to steal anything on it, such as credit card numbers or personal information.

So far, Zimperium told National Public Radio, the flaw has not been exploited, but in a blog post on its own website, it said that 95 percent of Android devices worldwide are vulnerable.

And that is potentially a lot of phones. In 2014, over 1 billion Android devices shipped worldwide, according to researcher Strategy Analytics, which expects the number to rise in 2015 and beyond. Zimperium called Stagefright the ""mother of all Android vulnerabilities.""

Google's Android software has been highly susceptible to security flaws for years, in part because of the open design that makes it popular as an alternative to Apple's iOS, the software that underlies the iPhone and iPad. In the first quarter, 99 percent of mobile malware targeted Android devices, according to security firm F-Secure.

And fixes to Android can take time to get to people's smartphones as those updates ripple through various phone makers and wireless service providers.

Zimperium said it discovered the issue in April and promptly informed Google.

A Google spokeswoman said that those intermediaries are armed with the patches they need to safeguard devices, though she did not offer specifics on which were ready to push those changes through, or when that might happen.

""The security of Android users is extremely important to us and so we responded quickly and patches have already been provided to partners that can be applied to any device,"" the Google spokeswoman said. ""Most Android devices, including all newer devices, have multiple technologies that are designed to make exploitation more difficult. Android devices also include an application sandbox designed to protect user data and other applications on the device.""

How the vulnerability gets exploited

The malware that would exploit the Android vulnerability hides inside a short video sent to a person's phone number, according to NPR, which reported on the bug Monday. As soon as the malicious text is received, features built into Stagefright to reduce lag time for viewing videos process the video to prepare it for viewing. That processing apparently is enough for bad guys to get their hooks into the platform and take control.

Exactly when the device might be exploited depends on the messaging platform a person employs. Those using the standard Messenger app built into Android would need to open the text message (but not necessarily watch the video) to fall victim to the trap. Those who are running Google's Hangouts app to handle text messaging, however, need not even open the application, according to Zimperium. As soon as Hangouts receives the text, it processes the video and the hacker is in. (The Google's Play app marketplace says Hangouts has been downloaded between 1 billion and 5 billion times.)

To compound the threat to Android devices, Google is largely powerless when it comes to actually getting patches to users. Phone makers including Samsung, LG and Huawei, as well as wireless carriers, all have control over how updates are sent to products.

Once Android is bundled into a product, it's typically been modified by those third parties. When security updates are required, Google can only send out a patch and after that, it's up to the phone maker or carrier to push those updates to phones.

Acknowledging that Android has become a destination for malware, Google in June announced a rewards program that pays researchers cash for finding bugs and holes that may be exploited in the operating system. Google has offered similar rewards programs to researchers for years with great effect. The company has doled out rewards to researchers who find flaws or security vulnerabilities in its Chrome browser and other software. In 2013, one security expert going by the name Pinkie Pie earned $50,000 for finding a particularly nasty bug in Chrome. Last year alone, Google paid out over $1.5 million to security researchers finding flaws in Chrome and other Google products. In total, the company has paid out $4 million since its bug bounties started in 2010.

Zimperium, which sent a patch to Google that the Android maker has accepted, told NPR that he estimates only 20 percent to 50 percent of Android devices currently in the wild will actually get the updates due to vendors being slow to react -- if they react at all.

While Zimperium says the risks are high for Stagefright to be exploited, and it's possible that malicious hackers will soon take advantage of the flaw, Android device owners have been dodging at least some malware. In April, Google issued a report claiming that malware installs on Android devices fell by 50 percent in 2014. By the end of the year, Google said that fewer than 1 percent of all Android devices had ""potentially harmful applications"" installed on them.

According to Zimperium's blog, it will show exactly how Stagefright works and can be exploited at the Black Hat hacker conference in Las Vegas, which starts August 1.

Zimperium did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",html

A main factor in this machine's metrics is the fact that every Windows installation on it is clean. With PC manufacturers loading so much crapware on new laptops, this is a bit of an unfair competition. But, on the other hand, PC makers should look at this data and aspire to ship PCs that perform just as well as a cleanly installed MacBook Pro.

The report went on to admit that it might be more fair to compare a cleanly installed MacBook Pro with a cleanly installed PC from Acer or Dell.

But there's method in Soluto's metrics: ""We simply compared the real PCs in the field....We believe it's more representative of reality.""

The metrics (see image at top) include crashes per week, hangs per week, Blue Screens (of Death) per week, and average boot time.

Soluto did list the disadvantages of running Windows on a Mac, including that it's more work to set up Windows on a Mac and there may be driver issues.

Acer's Aspire E1-571 came in second and Dell's XPS 13 received the third-highest ranking.

The Google vice president announced in on Google+ and Twitter this evening that ""There are now over 700,000 Android devices activated every day,"" clarifying later on Google+ that ""for those wondering, we count each device only once (ie, we don't count re-sold devices), and 'activations' means you go into a store, buy a device, put it on the network by subscribing to a wireless service.""

The new growth figure shows significant escalation in that it comes a month after Google announced that 550,000 devices were being activated every day--up from a daily tally of 500,000 in June and 400,000 in May.

Introduced via Hulu's new Labs testing bed, Hulu Desktop is one of four new apps in Labs. The other three include a Video Panel designer for customizing the look of Hulu embeds, a recommendations list, and original air date-based browsing--but Hulu Desktop is the only one available for download.

There are some stringent limitations to getting the desktop client to run properly, although if your system meets their standards, you'll get to play with some cool features. Windows users must have at least an Intel Pentium Core Duo, with a 1.8GHz processor and 2GB of RAM running Windows XP. Mac users need an Intel Pentium Core Duo, with a 2.0GHz and 2GB of RAM running OS X 10.4 (Tiger). Both Windows and Mac users should have at least a 2 Mbps Internet connection, and Flash 9.0.124 or later is a must.

Once running, the desktop client offers a smooth and reasonable facsimile of the features users should be familiar with from Hulu on the Web. You can use a Windows Media Center remote or an Apple remote to control it, further emphasizing the computer as a TV. Using the standard maximize window button in the upper-right corner of the pane will give you full-screen viewing.

Mouse over the video in the windowed mode to reveal the title of the video playing, its user rating, duration, and a button to jump to the main menu up at the top. A video progress timeline, volume control, buffer status, and video quality indicators live on the bottom. A handy preview pane appears when you mouse over the timeline.

The Web-based Hulu navigation in the menu remains the same. A scroll bar on the left smoothly moves from Now Playing down through Recently Added, TV, and Movies. A search feature available from a magnifying glass icon allows for Hulu-wide searching, and the scroll bar's Search option opens up a slick-feeling virtual keyboard.

In my testing, I encountered no stability issues, although some users have noted other results. The Hulu Desktop beta is currently free, although there's no indication from Hulu whether that will change in the future.",html

I shot a few of my own, as well as some from readers over to Comcast to get them answered. These are mostly items that did not appear in both the post about the amendment, or the otherwise comprehensive FAQ page.

Update at 5:05 p.m. PDT: In a bizarre twist, the previous answers to my questions were answered by someone named Bill G., who Comcast says is not an authorized spokesperson for the company, despite answering my e-mail sent through the company's press contacts page. Charlie Douglas, who is Director of Corporate Communications for Comcast's Online & Voice Services, wrote me back to let me know the ""correct"" answers to these questions. I've highlighted where the previous unofficial answers differed for the sake of continuity, although the only major differentiation from the unofficial contact is the mention of Comcast developing its own bandwidth monitoring and notification service for its customers, which is apparently not happening.

Charlie Douglas: If a customer receives a call that he/she has exceeded 250 GB in a month, then we ask them to please moderate their usage. The vast majority of customers do so voluntarily. During that first call, however, we also explain that, per our Acceptable Use Policy, if they are among our heaviest users for a second time in the following six months, that we reserve the right to suspend their account for 12 months. Again, this is an extremely small number of customers--far less than 1 percent--and is a policy that does not affect more than 99 percent of our customers.

Will there be a usage meter available on Comcast subscriber's online account information?

Douglas: There are numerous free or fee-based meters that are widely available on the Internet to anyone who wants one.

(Editor's note: This differs from our unofficial contact who said ""Comcast is developing a meter to track your bandwidth."" We've got a write-up of ways to do this using various software tools.)

Will you be offering larger bandwidth packages for home businesses or ""excessive users?""

Douglas: Our excessive use policy is only for residential service customers. As of today, this policy does not apply to our commercial services customers.

How does this factor in with users of your Digital Voice service? On average how much bandwidth does that service take up?

Douglas: Comcast Digital Voice is a completely separate service and is not a factor.

We've also had some questions about the bandwidth averages cited on this page. 2-3 GB median monthly bandwidth seems incredibly low, as does the figure for how large an e-mail is (0.05KB/e-mail). Most messages in my inbox hover between 10-50k. Was it a typo for 0.05MB?

Douglas: 2 to 3 GB/month is the median monthly amount used by our residential high-speed Internet customers. The examples we provided at www.comcast.net/networkmanagement are illustrative of how much activity would be required to reach 250GB in a month. More than 99 percent of our customers do not come close to using more than that amount.

In its State of the Mobile Web monthly report for September 2011, released first to CNET today, Opera revealed that Opera Mini users were more likely to use it for search on Android, for travel and tourism on iOS, for sports and technology on BlackBerry, for news on Windows Phones, and for social networking on feature phones.

Opera and its subsidiary AdMarvel unveiled not only a bucketload of metrics on what kinds of sites Opera Mini users visited on different platforms, but that 131.3 million people used the Opera Mini in September, and that the browser had decent growth in multiple countries and devices.

(Credit: Opera)

Opera Mini is uniquely suited for cross-platform analysis because it's one of the few browsers that exists across all major platforms, and the only cross-platform browser with such a large number of users. By a point of comparison, the 131 million worldwide users of Opera Mini stands in stark contrast to the 55 million people worldwide who use the desktop version of Opera, and is about 28 percent of Mozilla Firefox's unique user base of more than 450 million people.

As strong as these aggregate numbers are, they also don't provide a glimpse into the Balkanization trend that affects the plethora of mobile systems far more than desktops. Opera did not reveal how many of its Mini users were on iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Phone, or feature phones, and those numbers could give a clearer picture of how mobile browser use is developing. Some studies I've seen indicate that the mobile browser is the dominant app; while others cite data showing that apps blew past the browser sometime earlier this year. Also, it makes a huge difference, for example, if Opera Mini is used by tens of millions of feature phone users, but only a couple million people on smartphones.

Despite those concerns, 131 million Opera Mini users is an impressive benchmark to score.

The report showed that the ""unclassified"" category of sites dominated all platforms with 27 percent to 31.5 percent of browser use. After that, social networking dominated Opera Mini use. Feature phones used the browser for this more than any platform by a massive percentage margin, at 20.5 percent, while the others were in the 9 percent to 13 percent range. This is hardly surprising, given that feature phones don't have social networking apps to redirect attention away from the browser.

(Credit: Opera)

It's in the other categories that dominated Opera Mini use where the platform differentiation began to creep in. ""News and information"" followed social, with Android, iOS, Windows, and RIM users all within 1.7 percent of each other. News reading dropped off for feature phones, though, around 2 percent behind RIM and almost 4 percent behind Windows.

The percentage of people using in-browser search were about the same on all platforms, the next most popular interest, but showed variation in the category after it. 5.3 percent of people on Android used Opera Mini to browse to education sites, while the users of other platforms hovered around 4 percent. Meanwhile, RIM dominated with sports and tech sites.

Browser growth September was Opera Mini's strongest month yet, according to Opera. Not only was it used by upwards of 130 million people, more than 79 billion pages were served and 11.6 petabytes of data were compressed for Mini users. Opera Mini functions by redirect all Web traffic through its compression algorithms to speed up page-load times over slow connections and older hardware. Opera did clarify that these numbers do not include operator-installed versions of Opera Mini; only individual users are reflected here.

The 131.1 million users was an increase of 2.6 percent from the previous month, and an 84.2 percent increase in unique users since September 2010. And although page views actually dropped 0.5 percent from August 2011, they have increased 114.1 percent since a year ago.

The 11.6 petabytes of data transferred represents not the actual amount of data sent back and forth, but the total amount of data transferred and then uncompressed at a 90 percent rate. Since one of Opera Mini's big draws is that it shrinks the amount of bits being transferred, looking at the raw numbers can be misleading. The September 2011 amount of actual data transferred was 1.251 trillion megabytes, a 133.7 percent increase from the same month in 2010.

(Credit: Opera)

Opera also released a closer look at some of its Mini data from Europe. Basically, the continent is a strong indicator of Opera use because of its diversity of handsets. Of the top 10 phones in the top 10 Opera Mini countries in Europe, 71 were Nokia, 10 were Samsung, six were Sony Ericsson, six were BlackBerry, six were Alcatel, and one was LG.

So, page views in the top 10 European countries using Opera Mini increased by 129 percent, unique users by 54 percent, and data transferred went up by 125 percent.

The data published on top sites was far less revealing, except to indicate that people use Opera Mini to visit the same sites that you'd expect to see at the top of any desktop browser list. The most popular sites on Mini with Europeans were Google, Facebook, YouTube, and Wikipedia.

The massive growth of Opera Mini over the past year tells us several things about the state of mobile browsing. First, that although the highest-end handsets drive news, there is a huge public interest in a single browser that will work on all devices, from older feature phones to the latest from Apple. A big part of that is the ability to render the Web quickly, which Opera Mini can do in spades. We've also seen the idea reinforced that people use their mobile browser to check out the same kinds of high-profile sites that they do on their desktops, even as the users of different platforms begin to gravitate towards different specialized-interest sites. And finally, we can see that social networking is so big, that even on phones that have apps to support social networking sites, browser visits to social sites are a significant chunk of traffic.",html
https://www.cnet.com/news/wikileaks-cia-hacking-tools-phones-apple-samsung-microsoft-google/,"WikiLeaks: Here's how the CIA hacks your phones, TVs and PCs",,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Now Playing: Watch this: Can the CIA control your phone? WikiLeaks claims explained

WikiLeaks says it's released thousands of documents showing secret CIA hacking tools that the agency can use to break into our phones, cars, computers and smart TVs.

WikiLeaks, which has published everything from US diplomatic cables to emails addressed to Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, posted the alleged CIA documents Tuesday under the name ""Vault 7."" The documents could potentially reveal the agency's most important hacking techniques used to penetrate systems around the world. CNET is unable to verify whether the documents are real or have been altered.

""We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents,"" CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said in an email.

If the documents are the real deal, the leaks provide a glimpse into just how much access the CIA has into your life -- thanks to the gadgets you carry around all day. The magnitude of the hacking tools is jaw-dropping; the documents suggest the agency was able to break into the underlying operating systems running iPhones, Android phones and Windows and Linux computers.

That means it had access to data stored on the device and even to encrypted messages sent through popular services like WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram. In other cases, the hacks can turn gadgets like a Samsung Smart TV into listening devices, WikiLeaks said.

WikiLeaks has a long track record of releasing top secret government documents, and experts who've started to sift through the material said it appears legitimate, CBS News reported. Yet it's unclear whether these programs are still running and whether they affect the latest versions of each operating system.

'Untold value'

If the tools are currently in use, ""that has untold value,"" said Paul Rosenzweig, founder of cybersecurity company Redbranch Consulting and the former deputy assistant secretary for policy at the US Department of Homeland Security. ""If Samsung TV is inside Vladimir Putin's home, this is a good thing [for the CIA].""

On the other hand, Rosenzweig said it's unlikely the CIA is the only group that knows about the holes that let these hacking tools crack into phones and other devices. ""There's no reason to think these vulnerabilities are not also known to the Chinese, the Russians,"" he said.

These leaks come after more than a year of debate over government investigators accessing consumer devices. Frustrated at not being able to access encrypted information -- which is scrambled and unreadable without a password -- the government can get around encryption by buying or developing its own hacking tools that unlock devices.

The debate took off when the US Department of Justice sought to require Apple to help it open an encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters. After Apple fought back in court, the FBI said it had obtained another way to access the phone.

If the CIA could break into a phone's operating system, it wouldn't have to break the encryption; it would simply gain the same access to messages and data that regular users would have when unlocking a phone or computer.

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer declined to comment on the leaks.

Google and Motorola declined to comment on WikiLeaks' claims. Samsung said it was investigating the CIA's hacking tools.

""Protecting consumers' privacy and the security of our devices is a top priority at Samsung. We are aware of the report in question and are urgently looking into the matter,"" Samsung said in a statement.

Apple said late Tuesday that it had already addressed many issues described in the documents released by WikiLeaks.

""While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities,"" Apple said in a statement. ""We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates.""

For LG, the episode underscores the need for strong product security.

""Digital privacy isn't just an LG concern, it's an industry-wide issue that needs to be tackled by everyone who has a stake in the system, which is why we are completely committed to working with other industry players to make sure that consumers are protected to the fullest extent that today's technology will allow,"" LG said in a statement.

""We're aware of the report and are looking into it,"" a Microsoft spokesman said in an email.

Who can you trust?

Alex Rice, an executive at HackerOne who focuses on helping tech companies find and fix bugs in their systems, said the revelations will likely further strain the relationship between tech companies and the US government. Why? They make it harder for regular people to trust their devices, which is bad for the tech companies' bottom lines.

""The US economy relies significantly on the trust of its consumers, and if consumers can't trust US-made tech products, this harms competitiveness,"" Rice said in an email.

Signal said the takeaway from the WikiLeaks documents isn't about messaging apps.

""The CIA-WikiLeaks story today is about getting malware onto phones, none of the exploits are in Signal or break Signal Protocol encryption,"" said Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Signal. ""This story isn't about Signal or WhatsApp, but to the extent that it is, we see it as confirmation that what we're doing is working.""

Telegram said on its website that the problem lies with operating systems, not encrypted messaging apps, and that naming specific encrypted services is ""misleading."" WhatsApp declined to comment.

Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who leaked documents detailing NSA spy programs to journalists in 2013, wrote about the WikiLeaks documents Tuesday on Twitter. He said hacking the operating system is actually ""worse"" than hacking encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp.

Pokemon and hoarding

The hacking tools described by WikiLeaks go beyond merely opening encrypted devices. The WikiLeaks press release says the documents show the CIA developed tools to turn smart TVs into listening devices with a tool called ""Weeping Angel"" and sought to find ways to hack the control systems in internet-connected cars.

Like something out of a spy movie, other colorful code names include ""Brutal Kangaroo,"" a system to hide data images, and ""Hammer Drill,"" which infects software distributed on CDs or DVDs. Other code names include references to Pokemon.

The documents describe a vast CIA hacking operation covertly based in the US consulate in Frankfurt and covering Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The documents include instructions to help officers on temporary duty get through German immigration easily and get euros, and a reminder not to leave electronics or sensitive items unattended in hotel rooms.

""Paranoid, yes,"" the document reads, ""but better safe than sorry.""

WikiLeaks said the CIA had also ""hoarded"" vulnerabilities in the software run by tech giants like Apple and Microsoft, staying quiet about exploits so the agency could retain backdoor access.

The leaks came from a high-security CIA network in Langley, Virginia, according to WikiLeaks. The US spy agency appears to have targeted computers, phones and smart TVs, according to CBS News.

In a tweet, WikiLeaks said that the CIA showed ""negligence"" in not protecting the information WikiLeaks was publishing.

Ed McAndrew, a former federal cybercrime prosecutor who now practices privacy law at Ballard Spahr, said that if the leaked hacking tools have found their way to groups other than WikiLeaks, that could leave everyone vulnerable to them.

""Once this stuff is released into the wild of the internet, there's no getting it back,"" McAndrew said. ""It's pretty stunning, if legitimate, that this type of trove could be stolen and disseminated.""

That's not to say that there aren't any substantial new features, like the potential for Firefox extension importing, but this beta indicates that Microsoft is building on what they created in the last version, not reinventing their wheel.

Microsoft is promoting the Activities and Web Slices, a ""web clips"" feature that updates only selected parts of Web sites, such as front-page headlines or eBay auctions. What I found most interesting is that during the installation process, when you are asked if you'd like to import from another browser IE8 includes ""extensions"" with ""bookmarks"" and ""feeds"".

(Credit: CNET Networks)

Yup. Extensions.

Never say never, but I think the chances of the final version of IE8 supporting Firefox XPIs is slim. What's more likely is that Microsoft is trying to build the IE community and developers into creating more add-ons for IE. In this beta, when you import extensions, IE opens up the Windows Marketplace Web site and automatically searches for analogues to your Firefox extensions.

The Activities feature is a place to consolidate things you do on the Web: blogging, searching, word definition, and so on. There's also a toolbar button that switches the rendering engine back to IE7, but it requires a browser restart and frustratingly there's not a button for that.

The default setting for IE8 is to strip out the favorites from behind their toolbar button in IE7 and give them their own toolbar, but this actually detracts from the slick interface design. As with most Microsoft products, IE8 requires a system restart.

Empirically, pages seemed to load at about the same speed or a little bit faster as compared to IE7. Compared with Firefox 3 beta 3, though, and Firefox was noticeably faster on graphics- and script-heavy pages.

Don't forget that this is a beta release, and so it's likely to be very buggy and work imperfectly at best.",html

It was a tough decision for Firefox on Android: improve the browser's performance or keep its compatibility with add-ons and other technology?

But after creating a prototype, Mozilla settled on the winning answer quickly: performance. And tomorrow, a month after making the decision, Mozilla plans to release an early version of the overhauled Firefox for Android.

The organization will introduce the new version on the ""nightly"" channel, where Mozilla tests raw new technology. With the organization's rapid-release cycle, the nightly version graduates to the Aurora, beta, and final-release channels, maturing for six weeks in each phase.

The new version is strategically important for Mozilla for multiple reasons. First, smartphones and tablets are at the center of a mobile-first transformation of the computing industry, and Firefox isn't preinstalled anywhere right now. Second, with Firefox shut out on Apple's iOS and Microsoft's Windows Phone, Android is effectively the only route for Mozilla to bring its browser to the mobile market.

Last, Mozilla's objective--to ensure an open Web--relies on Firefox. Right now, Apple and Google browsers based on the open-source WebKit project dominate mobile browsing.

Release manager Christian Legnitto announced the move Friday. Initially the new version was geared just for phones, but Mozilla expanded it to tablets, too, after concluding it couldn't offer separate versions.

Firefox for personal computers, and many of the add-ons that helped make the browser popular by making it more customizable, use an interface called XUL (XML User Interface Language). But because the XUL-based version of Firefox took so long to start up on Android and isn't as responsive, Mozilla instead embraced Andoid's built-in technology.

Among the native interface advantages, according to programmer Mark Finkle:

Startup--A native UI can be presented much faster than a XUL based UI, since it can happen in parallel with Gecko startup. This means startup times in fractions of a second, versus several seconds for a XUL UI on some phones.

Memory Use--We believe a native UI will use significantly less memory.

Responsiveness--A native UI has the potential for beautiful panning and zooming performance.

It comes at a cost, though. XUL-based add-ons are one issue.

""Native UI builds are considered a new application and are not add-on compatible with the XUL versions,"" Finkle said

Mozilla is working on a new approach for add-ons on Android, though, through an interface called NativeWindow, Finkle said. And in a comment, Finkle added that it could be possible to build Firefox's newer Jetpack interface for add-ons atop the NativeWindow foundation.

There are other challenges, too, with the new version. The current Firefox Sync, for example, no longer works as a way to share bookmarks, passwords, and open tabs across multiple versions of the browser. A native version of Sync for Android is under construction, though, and due to arrive in December. Also being addressed is the fact that the current upgrade path drops saved passwords and browsing history.

Another list of objections came from Robert Kaiser, a Firefox project contributor, who listed his misgivings in a mailing list message: ""The awesomebar algorithm [which suggests full links based on what people type in the adress bar] will be removed. The privacy of bookmarks and history will be removed. Open video might get undermined,"" he said. ""A lot of Add-on awesomeness will be removed... Somehow I don't believe you fully there.""

All these are potential problems, to be sure. But not as big as people not using the browser at all because it's too slow.",html
http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/keep-your-android-phone-secure/,Keep your Android phone secure,"August,Pm,Clifford Col",2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Read enough about Android security threats, and you might think that the safest thing is to turn off your phone, wrap it tightly in tinfoil, and hide it in your junk drawer. Hackers are stepping up their game -- Stagefright, the recently discovered platform vulnerability, exposes up to 95 percent of all Android devices to malicious attacks.

Mobile phones are attractive targets, getting more attractive as they become ever more functional. Phones keep financial information, details of our professional and personal lives, shopping behaviors, breadcrumbs of daily activities. For example, many of us use our phones for mobile banking and payments. What criminal wouldn't want access to those accounts?

But don't foil your phone just yet. By following our commonsense steps, you can reduce your risk of exposure to malign activities. And if the worst happens and you lose control of your phone, you can minimize the damage.

Set a screen-lock password or PIN

It seems reckless to not take this first simple step, but a recent survey reports that as many as half of mobile phone users don't lock their screen with a PIN, password, pattern, or fingerprint. With a screen lock, each time you turn on or wake up your device, you'll be asked to unlock it.

To set a screen lock, go to Settings, tap Lock Screen and Security, and set up your screen lock.

On its own, a screen lock will only block those with physical access to your phone from gaining access to your data, so don't set a screen lock and think you're safe. Some apps, such as the phone and camera, provide limited use from the lock screen. And recent reports suggest that Android passwords, PINs, and even fingerprints can be hacked, so consider a screen lock a good first step and keep reading.

While you're setting up your screen lock, make sure you're using a strong password for your Google account, and consider using a password manager, which lets you easily use strong, unique passwords for websites and apps. A recent Google security report noted that a password manager is part of a solid strategy to stay safe online.

Update your Android OS and apps

Here's another easy and effective step: Keep your Android operating system and apps up to date. Google and third-party app-makers frequently update their software, adding new features and patching security holes. Keeping software up to date can help ensure you are protected from new threats.

Although your phone should notify you if an update to the Android OS is waiting to be installed, you can check for updates too by going to Settings, navigating to System updates, and tapping ""Check for system update.""

To update your apps, open the Play Store, go to My Apps, and update any apps that show a new version is available.

Unfortunately, you may see a lag between the time Google identifies a software security hole and when the security patch finally reaches your phone. The patch often has to make its way from Google to your handset maker, then your carrier, and finally to your device. However, Google, Samsung, and LG have pledged to release monthly security updates for their devices in an effort to shorten the space between the appearance of malware and the release of a security patch.

Beware of links in email, on websites, and in social posts

Phishing continues to be a major -- and increasingly sophisticated -- security problem. While some users get hacked through an active attack, many people open up their own security holes by getting caught in a phishing scam or by downloading malware from untrustworthy sites. Be smart about links in emails, on websites, and in posts, and if a link looks suspicious, don't click it. (See ""Security software"" below for more on now to be safe with shady websites.)

Use public Wi-Fi with caution

If you're using a public Wi-Fi hotspot -- in a cafe, in a hotel, on a plane -- experts say you should assume someone is snooping on you, trying to grab your information.

While some recommend that you turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth when out in public, that kind of defeats the purpose of having a mobile device. Most email services and e-commerce and financial sites offer secure connections by default, which provides a measure of protection when using Wi-Fi in public places, and browser makers are adding security features that will warn you when you're trying to access an insecure site. For additional security, a VPN allows you to create a private connection over a public network to send and receive sensitive data, such as credit-card information.

Download from the Google Play Store, and check app permissions

Security experts warn that a significant source of malware is websites claiming to offer free versions of paid apps, such as a free version of a paid upgrade for Angry Birds. You save 99 cents, but you now have malware on your phone, too. It's safer to download apps through the Google Play Store than through third-party sites, as Google monitors its store for malicious apps.

Also, before you install an app, read which permissions you are giving it. Scroll to the bottom of the app's Google Play page and tap Permission details. If you have concerns, such as why a flashlight app needs access to your contacts, find a similar app with permissions you are more comfortable with.

Use security software

Antivirus and security software can scan for malicious apps, warn you about suspicious websites, and offer security for lost phones. An antivirus app doesn't make you less responsible for the security of your phone, however. It works in coordination with the other steps listed here; it is not a replacement for them. Several publishers make Android security apps, including Avast, Lookout, and McAfee.

Take advantage of Android Device Manager

Losing your device or having it stolen can be just as damaging as having it hacked. Android Device Manager can help you locate a lost phone or tablet, reset the screen lock PIN, and (if you can't recover your device) erase the phone's data.

Protect your Google account

If something goes wonky with your Google account -- say, you lose your password or Google notices unusual activity -- Google can assist you through a recovery email or phone number. If you really want to be safe, set up two-step verification. With that additional step, Google sends your phone a single-use code you enter when you sign in. That way if someone does get your password, they still won't be able to get into your account. Head over to your accounts page to set up a recovery number and two-step verification.

If one in 50 people on the Web move from Firefox to Chrome, Google's browser will unseat Mozilla's for the No. 2 spot in worldwide usage.

That's because, according to Net Applications' November browser usage measurements, Chrome is now within 4 percentage points of Firefox. With a 2 percentage-point increase in one and a 2 percentage-point decrease in the other, Google comes out on top.

Firefox dropped 0.4 percentage point to 22.1 percent of usage in November, while Chrome gained 0.7 percent to 18.2 percent. If that rate was to continue, Chrome would outpace Firefox in March 2012, but fluctuations make such predictions difficult.

Firefox once was the prime challenger to Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which for years languished in the doldrums of software development. Now it shares that role with Chrome and, to a lesser degree, Apple's Safari. Microsoft is in high gear again, though, with IE9 a credible challenger and IE10 shaping up to be a strong competitor when it's finished in 2012.

The browser market is now fiercely competitive as browser makers use the software to drive their agendas. For Microsoft, it's about the Metro user interface in Windows 8; for Google, it's browsing speed and Web applications; for Mozilla, it's a Web built on openness and standards; and for Apple, the best mobile devices.

Net Applications

In November, IE's steady decline stopped, with Microsoft's browser holding steady at 56.2 percent of usage. Microsoft has largely written off Windows XP users by requiring Windows Vista or Windows 7 for its current IE9. The company measures its performance by Windows 7 usage. there, IE9 passed Chrome and Firefox in usage and now trails only IE8.

The vast majority of browser usage today is from personal computers--92.2 percent. But with smartphones and tablets, mobile-device usage is generally increasing. In November, it reached a record 6.7 percent, according to Net Applications.

The top mobile browser by far is Apple's Safari, but it plunged 7 percentage points to 55.0 percent of usage in November. The Android browser had bumped Opera Mini aside in October for the second-place spot, but in November, Opera Mini clawed its way back. Opera's lightweight browser, which runs on thousands of phones, surged 7 percentage points to 20.1 percent, while the Android browser dropped 2.2 percentage points to 16.4 percent.

Opera also offers a full-fledged browser, Opera Mobile, for higher-end smartphones. But that remains relatively rare at 0.4 percent of mobile browser usage.",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-10270045-12.html,TuneWiki: Stream song lyrics from Windows Media Player,"June,Pm,Jessica Dolcourt",2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"TuneWiki is one of the most ambitious social music projects we've seen. It is part licensed lyrics spooler for your own songs and for streaming YouTube videos, and part network--you can see where else in the world other TuneWiki users are playing your track. What began as an Android app created for Google's Android Developer Challenge (and finished as one of 10 winners) grew into a Web site and is, as of Monday, a Windows Media Player plug-in.

TuneWiki for Windows Media Player has a few flubs and flaws, but on average, the lyrics and music maps add the utility and interest to make the free application a helpful addition to Windows Media Player.

Those familiar with TuneWiki's Web site will see the similarities right away. TuneWiki's interface reskins Windows Media Player's 'Now Playing' window. The top half of the screen displays either a music map of where else in the world songs are playing, a YouTube video, album art, or top songs nearby, depending on if you're playing a song from your library, watching a YouTube video through TuneWiki, or browsing the map.

The bottom half of the screen, below the ad space, is where you'll see the available lyrics stream, plus commands to translate into other languages, help TuneWiki resync the song, and expose the scroll bar for manual lyrics perusal.

The unskinned Windows Media Player playlist forms the right side bar unless you banish it. We suggest you don't--you may have a harder time queuing songs if you do.

TuneWiki has its share of rough edges. Some tools aren't immediately intuitive, like the resyncing button. Instead of clicking it to have the song resync itself, you click it, then click each line of the song as it plays to help TuneWiki time the lyrics more accurately. Unless you're an approved editor, your version of the time-synced lyrics will be stored locally, but may not make it into TuneWiki's larger database.

Also not obvious is the fact that only approved editors can edit existing lyrics. A text notice on the editor-only area would wipe away potential confusion and frustration. Anyone, however, can add lyrics to TuneWiki's wiki if there aren't any to begin with. (You can apply to be an editor at forums.tunewiki.com. TuneWiki currently tallies abut 1,500 editors.)

Some other issues we encountered were performance-based or preference-related. We'd like the size of the YouTube video to be adjustable, for instance. If the YouTube video stops, as it did once during testing, we want to refresh it without closing and reopening the app. When searching for songs, we'd like a more elegant display of the artist and album information returned in the results. TuneWiki's plug-in is good enough to use on its own, but in a few iterations from now, after a scrub-up, it should be even more promising.",html

Was the hype good, or bad, and who is to blame?

""I'm not sure what to think,"" said Bruce Schneier, chief security technology officer at BT, who is usually critical or pessimistic. ""In a sense, the whole Conficker thing just puts a name on a general problem.""

The problem is that there are tons of malicious programs and attacks out there on the Internet every day and people don't do enough to protect their computers, experts say. People need to be vigilant in patching their systems and updating their antivirus and other security software all the time, and not just when there is a virus outbreak. This isn't new at all. (See also: ""Viruses with trigger dates."")

Lots of other worms and botnets are doing real damage, experts say, but Conficker garnered the media attention because it was configured to activate on a certain date. The fact that the date happened to be April Fools' Day only lended to its mystique.

""You need something with a name and a date to make the news. Today, the problem is just as serious, but there's no news,"" Schneier said.

A member of the Conficker Working Group, a consortium of companies and experts formed to eradicate the worm, had this to say: ""The focus on April 1 ignored the fact that malware is out there and it is not detected easily and it has counter measures,"" said Dave Dittrich, an affiliate researcher at the University of Washington.

People tend to blame the security vendors for hyping viruses so they can sell more products. But in this case, everyone CNET News talked to about Conficker downplayed the digital disaster scenario and said things would likely be fairly quiet on April 1, as they were.

Media culpability

That leaves the media. In a spoof on the media frenzy, Wired ran a humorous fake live blog from the ""Conficker Worm War Room"" and pointed out that ""The New York Times called it an 'unthinkable disaster' in the making. CBS's 60 Minutes said the worm could 'disrupt the entire internet,' and The Guardian warned that it might be a 'deadly threat.'""

Surprisingly, Dittrich and others were somewhat forgiving. ""Tight deadlines make it hard to get a good story out without the hype taking over,"" he said. ""There was a known deadline of April 1 for some behavior changing, but it wasn't clear what that behavior was going to be.""

But just like the boy who cried wolf too many times or Chicken Little after the sky didn't fall, the experts said they worried that conflated expectations that are not met could mean people will ignore legitimate threats in the future.

Simple concepts of good and bad are easy to understand, while complicated issues and relative conditions, which underpin security, aren't. For instance, Dan Kaminsky, director of penetration testing at IOActive, said he often finds himself trying to talk people down off of one of two ""ledges"" of thinking.

""It's either 'nothing is going to happen', and that's not true, or it's 'the world is coming to an end and computers are going to explode in some technological Ebola equivalent,' and that's not true either,"" he said, echoing comments he made in a post on his blog. ""Concern, but not panic, is really the appropriate engineering response to the problems of this nature. But concern doesn't sell nearly as well as panic.""

Hype is one thing. Public awareness is another, and if nothing else, all the attention Conficker garnered can be seen as a benefit if it means that more people were prompted to secure their systems.

""When you see your neighbor with a cold, you think about washing your hands,"" said Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer at Veracode.

""The main lesson is that reactive security is always bad,"" said Wysopal. ""This is the case we're seeing here. Once the botnet is spread it is really difficult to clean up and the command-and-control (aspect) is getting more sophisticated and using sophisticated encryption. Once it is in place it is harder and harder to dismantle and remove.""

""I find it a bit discouraging that after SO many years of these dire warnings of a virus/worm that will 'bring the Internet to its knees' that executive management STILL doesn't get the fact they shouldn't be depending on media stories to shape their security program,"" Carole Fennelly, director of content and documentation at Tenable Network Security and a former security consultant, wrote in an e-mail.

Conficker alive and well

Meanwhile, Conficker remains a menace. The worm spreads through a hole in Windows that Microsoft patched in October and also spreads via removable storage devices and weakly protected network shares.

So, millions of infected computers didn't launch denial-of-service attacks on Web sites or download password-stealing software on Wednesday. But they could have, and they still can at any point in the future. In fact, the risk is greater now because Conficker-infected machines can distribute updates or instructions via encrypted peer-to-peer technology as opposed to communicating to command-and-control servers at domains that registrars have been pro-actively blocking.

""It's not like it's gone,"" said Kaminsky, who worked with The Honeynet Project on a way to detect infected computers using a flaw in Conficker's code. ""We're looking at a massive, amorphous network with a command and control that we don't have the means to block anymore. Things got worse on April 1 for the remaining infected nodes.""

And now there is no signal for researchers to watch for with Conficker. This actually makes sense for a botnet because their creators usually tend to operate under the radar so they are not thwarted.

""We believe they decided to do nothing to tip their hand,"" said Paul Ferguson, an advanced threats researcher at Trend Micro. ""But the functionality can be updated at any given point in time. All it takes is a button click on a mouse from the people pulling the strings.""

The April 1 date could have been designed to distract people from other activity. For instance, researchers saw updates to existing botnets that also use auto-domain generation, including Mebroot, which is also known as Torpig and Sinowal, according to Ferguson. That Trojan infects Windows computers in ""drive-by downloads"" as they Web surf and steals bank log-in data and other sensitive data, among other things.

""I'm not saying these are connected, but it sure is funny in a coincidental way,"" Ferguson said.

So, what's the moral of the Conficker story?

""The moral is there are big worms out there and criminals that do a bunch of things,"" said Schneier. ""One of them happens to have a name and a date.""

LAS VEGAS--The hacker conference DefCon kicked off this morning with the rare public sighting of a now-archaic piece of technology: the 5 1/4-inch floppy disk. Mikko Hypponen, the chief technical officer for the Finnish security company F-Secure, waved the disk above his head to start off his history of PC viruses, and said, ""This is Brain.""

Hypponen was talking about a guest of honor housed on the disk: the original computer virus. Hypponen found the disk last year in a lockbox in F-Secure's headquarters in Helsinki, and he dove in, cracked the virus code, and found in it the names and address of the virus' writers, two brothers from a town near Lahore, Pakistan. And--believe it or not--he went to the address and found the same brothers there, now running an Internet service provider called Brain Communications. (Hypponen details his trip in a short YouTube film.)

One of the important things he learned from them is that they said they had no malicious intent when they created the virus. ""There was no real motive,"" said Hypponen. It was a proof-of-concept, created just to prove that it could be done. This was to inform computer virus development until the first years of the new century, as viruses grew more malicious and complicated, but were essentially pranks.

Just because they were pranks doesn't mean they weren't harmful, though. Hypponen demonstrated a number of early computer viruses from which he had removed the infectors, including one called Disk Destroyer. This particular piece of nastiness would copy the contents of your hard disk into the RAM, then wipe your drive. It then loaded a rudimentary slot machine-style game, and gave you five chances to win. If you won, it would reload your data back onto your hard drive. If you lost, your data was permanently wiped out.

Though viruses continued to get more and more complex, it wasn't until 2003 that things began to change. First, Microsoft began to take computer viruses seriously, he said, because worm infections were causing serious Internet traffic packet loss and causing real-world damage. Trains in 2003 were stopped around Washington, D.C., because the Windows computers controlling the signals and routing systems had crashed. ""This is the basic reason why serious problems like these were finally taken seriously,"" Hypponen noted.

(Credit: Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

The other major change in 2003 was the Fizzer infection. ""Fizzer, which nobody here remembers, is one of the most important viruses in history. It was the first virus written with one purpose only: making money."" Fizzer spread e-mail spam in an effort to rake in the dough. Hypponen said that when other virus writers realized they too could earn some bucks from writing malicious code, it was game on.

This began to have even more serious real-world implications, as some virus writers were found to have used their money to buy equipment for fighters in Iraq.

""We also began to see a geographical shift [in] where viruses were written,"" he said. ""From 1986 to 2003, it was mostly Western countries, the U.S., Western Europe, Japan. From 2003 on, it was Russia, Eastern Europe, Ukraine, China (of course), and South America, especially Brazil.""

However, Hypponen said the problem was not only limited to criminals. He called out the president of Sony BMG, Thomas Hesse, to calls of derision from the audience. Hesse was instrumental in approving a DRM system that surreptitiously installed a rootkit on your computer when you played a CD from that computer. ""Sony gets a lot of hate, and they deserve it. Of course, some would claim that if you listen to Celine Dion, you get what you deserve,"" Hypponen quipped.

But he especially called out Hesse for saying, ""Most people, I think, don't even know what a rootkit is, so why should they care about it?"" Hypponen retorted, ""Most people don't even know what brain damage is, so why should they care about it, too?""

(Credit: Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Hypponen talked about the technical complexity of the 2008 virus Mebroot, a trojan that infects the master boot record of computers and is exceptionally difficult to remove because of it, and ransomware like GPCode, which holds your computer hostage until you wire money to the virus writers. Stuxnet, though, was an embarrassment for the security industry, Hypponen said.

""All this work did not prepare us for what we found next. It was embarrassing. We missed Stuxnet for a freaking year,"" he said, shaking his head.

""Today when you get infected by viruses, you will not know,"" Hypponen said. ""It's running silently in the background. It won't slow down your system, and it won't take up too much of your resources.""

""It has been a pretty wild ride over the past 25 years, from Brain to Stuxnet. Many things have changed, many things haven't changed. Brain didn't spread on the Internet, it didn't exist,"" Hypponen said, alluding to the spread by floppy disk. ""And Stuxnet spread by USB key.""",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57449245-93/facebook-officially-launches-mobile-app-center/,Facebook officially launches mobile 'App Center',,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"Facebook tonight unveiled its mobile App Center as it amps up its efforts to improve its mobile business.

The new app center, the company's first big announcement since its IPO, went live tonight with more than 600 apps, including Nike+ GPS, Ubisoft Ghost Recon Commander, Stitcher Radio, Draw Something, and Pinterest.

""The app center represents a new way for users to discover social applications,"" said Douglas Purdy, Facebook's director of developer products, who showed off the App Center at a launch party in San Francisco. Plus, he says, it gives developers a way to reach Facebook's more than 900 million users. Facebook was responsible for 83 million visits to the Apple App Store in May, Facebook said.

CNET/Dan Farber

The App Center is designed to offer an experience personalized for each user, with app recommendations based on the apps they and their friends use. So if you're a person who likes word games -- something Facebook would know from your Facebook behavior -- the App Center will surface those sorts of apps for you. Then, when you select an app you like, you'll be sent to the Apple's App Store or Google's, depending on your device.

Even so, most Facebook users will have to wait before they can check out the App Center. Tonight's rollout -- full of big stats and optimism at an event it held in San Francisco -- will only go live for between 6 percent and 8 percent of Facebook's U.S. users, said Matt Wyndowe, the company's product manager for games and apps. The company it will roll out to all U.S. users in the coming weeks. Eventually, said Wyndowe, there will be different App Centers customized for different parts of the word.

Dan Farber/CNET

Facebook's team has been working to approve apps that it would feature for the rollout. For now, the company is relying on a mix of algorithms and humans to decide what apps it features. He said his team is reviewing apps for technical aspects and functionality. ""We review them all,"" said Wyndowe.

Ultimately, Facebook wants the algorithms to do most of the work in figuring out apps to feature. And given Facebook's huge audience, a prominent spot will surely be a boon to developers -- much as getting featured in Apple's App Store can turn an app into a hit.

Asked if Facebook was considering selling digital goods and apps directly to consumers -- taking on Google and Apple -- Wyndowe said it's not in the immediate plans.

The App Center is available on mobile via the Facebook apps for iOS and Android, and by accessing Facebook.com on mobile. A huge amount of Facebook's mobile traffic goes through the mobile Web, not via apps.

Today's announcement comes a month after Facebook first said it was launching an App Center, which it billed mainly as a way to help users discover the best social apps and to drum up interest from developers.

Facebook is under enormous pressure to figure out ways to make money from mobile. And in the run up to the IPO, Zuckerberg told investors that mobile was his key priority for 2012.

Today's announcement amps up its mobile efforts, but it doesn't help it turn mobile traffic into dollars. ""Nothing has changed about monetization,"" said Wyndowe. ""For us, it's about how do we delight users.""

Of course, it's also about how Facebook gathers data from its users. In that way, the App Center should help a ton as more and more people use apps that are integrated with Facebook.

The company has recently been making others changes to its mobile products as well. Just yesterday it rolled out a ""low-friction"" mobile payment system to make it easier to make payments for virtual or digital goods via its app. And last month it redesigned itsmobile interface to display larger photos.

Facebook had 488 million monthly average unique usersof its mobile products in March -- more than half of its 901 million users in all -- and is only just starting to experiment with ways to make money from mobile. One problem is that it simply can't show as many ads on a mobile device since the screens are smaller.

Facebook's mobile challenge -- a challenge shared by most all Web companies -- has contributed to the wave pessimism about Facebook's stock. Shares of Facebook closed today at $26.31, more than 30 percent down from their offering price of $38 a share.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10449661-245.html,"Microsoft, Google split over browser bug bounty",,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"To entice security researchers to look for holes in the Chrome browser, Google has announced it will pay $500 for bugs found in the code. But several experts say that's not enough money to motivate skilled vulnerability researchers.

""I think it's ridiculous,"" Charlie Miller, a senior security researcher at Independent Security Evaluators, said when asked Monday for his opinion of Google's new bug bounty program. ""It's insulting. It's so low.""

Under Google's new ""experimental"" incentive program, announced last week, people will get paid $500 for select interesting and original security vulnerabilities discovered in Chrome, or $1,337 for particularly severe or clever bugs. That figure refers to the geek term for elite, or ""leet,"" which can be spelled out using the numbers.

Mozilla pays $500 to researchers who find valid security bugs in the Firefox browser, the Thunderbird e-mail client, or the Mozilla suite.

Jeremiah Grossman, chief technology officer and co-founder of WhiteHat Security, said Google's plan could be the start of an interesting trend.

""If a researcher is purely interested in the dollar reward, then by all means he should go where the dollar is highest. But if you happen to find one because it's fun and interesting to you, then you'll get paid too,"" he said. ""I've been suggesting Microsoft should do this for a long time but they have a moral issue with it.""

Microsoft is sticking with its no-bounty stance.

""Microsoft does not offer compensation for information regarding security vulnerabilities. We do not believe that offering compensation for vulnerability information is the best way we can help protect our customers,"" said Dave Forstrom, group manager of Microsoft Trustworthy Computing. ""We also do not think it fosters the growth of a healthy ecosystem.""

You would think Google would be roundly praised for offering to pay researchers for work they often do for free. But not everyone is impressed.

""It's probably better to pay professional QA [quality assurance] people and pen [penetration] testers than to expect the public to do your testing for you on the cheap,"" said Gary McGraw, chief technology officer at Cigital and a specialist in secure code writing processes. ""No excellent professional tester I know would be attracted by a bounty like that--perhaps adolescents would do it for beer money (or rather Red Bull and vodka money).""

Miller's criticism might be particularly stinging, given that he announced a campaign called ""No More Free Bugs,"" about a year ago. He argued that vendors should pay when outside researchers discover vulnerabilities in their commercial software instead of freeloading on the efforts of volunteer bug hunters whose work ends up making the products safer.

""In some senses this is my dream come true,"" Miller said. ""I've been begging vendors for this. And then when it happens I'm bitter and critical,"" because it's so much lower than what researchers can make from bounty programs at VeriSign iDefense's Vulnerability Contributor Program and the Zero Day Initiative run by 3Com's TippingPoint.

""If I did find a bug in Chrome, I could sell it to the Zero Day Initiative and make $2,000 and it still gets reported to Google eventually, so why would I give it to Google for $500? It doesn't make sense,"" he said.

Pedram Amini, who runs the Zero Day Initiative, wouldn't say exactly how much the program pays for bugs, but did allow that ""on average it's over 10 times what Google's offering.""

""Google is the first huge company to create a bug bounty. I'm happy they're doing it. It's a step in the right direction,"" he said. ""But pricing-wise, they're not going to be able to compete with other bug bounty programs.""

On the bright side

Granted, it might be easier to find bugs in beta software than in products that have been released to the public, which the Zero Day Initiative focuses on, according to Amini. And it's wise for Google to do something to attract the attention of researchers to its browser, which is much newer and has fewer users than the other major browsers, he said.

""I think there is going to be a subset of people who will use the Google program,"" he said. ""One thing that is certain--vulnerabilities do have value.""

Google's pay scheme is at the low end of what iDefense pays, according to Rick Howard, director of iDefense Intelligence.

""Google has always shown that it is willing to take on large and complex projects for which it has no past experience and make a success of it. I see no reason why they should not succeed in this one,"" Howard said.

And Google doesn't always go cheap. Last July, it paid more than $8,000 to a team of researchers that won a Native Client Security Contest.

Asked to comment on complaints that $500 is too little compensation for bug hunters, Chris Evans of the Google Security Team wrote in an e-mail: ""We took care to design the program to allow for a wide variety of bugs to qualify for payment and to make it easier for researchers to participate--for example, we don't necessarily need a working exploit (which is often much more difficult than finding a bug) and we're interested in bugs even if they manifest within the Chromium sandbox.""

Chromium is the open-source project for Google's Chrome browser and unreleased Chrome operating system. Evans said it was too early to say whether Chrome OS would be included in the bounty program after it launches.

""Chromium has already benefited from collaboration with security researchers, and we expect they will continue to scrutinize the Chromium code and help us improve it regardless of any action we take,"" he said. ""To them, this reward can be seen as a token of appreciation. To others, we hope the addition of a reward may encourage new people to participate beyond how they might have otherwise.""",html

Nor does that encompass the dozen or so messages sitting in my personal account. That's quite a lot of e-mail to sift through, especially for a person who cringes at the sight of unread messages in her in-box. But once I've marked them as read, it then becomes a chore to keep track of what needs a response and when. Incidentally, this is precisely the reason that NudgeMail caught my eye.

This handy service, developed by San Francisco-based consumer product experience firm Stage Two, is about as straightforward as they come, which is an integral part of its appeal (disclosure: Jeremy Toeman, a founding partner of Stage Two, is also a columnist for CNET). NudgeMail provides one feature: it turns any e-mail client into a reminder system. So say you receive a message that necessitates a reply, but not until Friday. Simply forward the e-mail to ""friday@nudgemail.com"" and, on Friday, the message will be sent back to you for response. You can also schedule items for particular dates; for example, for the 22nd of November, you would forward the message to ""11222010@nudgemail.com.""

It's really as simple as that. There are no registrations, no users, no widgets to toy with--just e-mail. And as many of us know, forwarding an e-mail is about the quickest and easiest process there is. Better yet, NudgeMail works from pretty much any platform--Android, BlackBerry, iPhone, Yahoo, Outlook, Gmail...the list goes on and on. And it's completely free, at least for now. The service is currently in beta; once it goes live in prime time, the developer asserts that free users will still get a ""limited but useful quantity of monthly nudges,"" while those who subscribe to the premium service will get unlimited nudges and extra features.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-20003782-37.html,The people involved in sale of lost iPhone revealed,,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"The saga of the lost prototype iPhone started with a 21-year-old Silicon Valley resident who says he regrets not trying harder to find its real owner, according to a published report.

Brian J. Hogan, a 21-year-old resident of Redwood City, Calif., is the person who found the iPhone and was paid by Gizmodo, according to a story published on Thursday by Wired.com.

Hogan's lawyer issued a statement to Wired and said Hogan was in the bar with friends when another patron handed him the phone after finding it on a nearby stool, asked around if anyone owned it, and then left the bar with his friend and the prototype.

Hogan, however, had help in finding a buyer for the phone. CNET has learned that Sage Robert Wallower, a 27-year-old University of California at Berkeley student, contacted technology sites about what is believed to be Apple's next-generation iPhone. The device was lost by an Apple engineer last month. Police in San Mateo County have said they are investigating the lost phone as a possible theft.

Wired reported that police have interviewed Hogan, but that he has not been charged with a crime and that his attorney said he will cooperate with the investigation.

CNET's sources said Wallower, a former Navy cryptologic technician who transferred to UC Berkeley two years ago, acted as a go-between. CNET has learned that there were at least three people involved: Hogan, Wallower, and someone else connected to the sale. Records indicate that Wallower and Hogan may have attended Santa Barbara City College during the same period.

Wallower, who is listed as a member of Berkeley's class of 2010, says in a LinkedIn profile, currently unavailable, that he previously worked as a computer security officer at the publicly traded Securitas corporation and that he possesses ""top-secret clearance.""

In an in-person interview with CNET at his home in Oakland on Thursday, Wallower said, ""I'm not the person who found it. I didn't see it or touch it in any manner. But I know who found it."" He declined to identify anyone else, however, in part because he said conversations with law professors had convinced him that Apple was a ""legal juggernaut.""

""I need to talk to a lawyer,"" Wallower said. ""I think I have already said too much.""

--Sage Wallower, student ""I need to talk to a lawyer. I think I have already said too much.""--Sage Wallower, student

The aspiring student senator, whose Facebook campaign page appears to have been taken down, has, according to the sources, emerged as one of the central figures in a drama unfolding in a uniquely Silicon Valley way. After Gizmodo published details last week about what it believes was a prototype iPhone, San Mateo County sheriffs raided the home of one of the gadget blog's editors, prompting a debate about whether the warrant complied with California and federal laws curbing newsroom searches. A lawyer for Gizmodo says the gadget blog could sue the sheriff's office.

San Mateo County prosecutors have confirmed that investigators interviewed the person they believe found the prototype in a German beer garden called the Gourmet Haus Straudt.

Stephen Wagstaffe, chief deputy district attorney, declined to confirm whether Hogan was the person who found or sold the iPhone. He did say the felony criminal investigation into possible theft was still going on and that no charges have been filed. ""We are still collecting facts,"" he said.

Under a California law dating back to 1872, any person who finds lost property and knows who the owner is likely to be--but ""appropriates such property to his own use""--is guilty of theft. In addition, a second state law says any person who knowingly receives property that has been obtained illegally can be imprisoned for up to one year.

An Amazon.com list, currently unavailable, that appeared to have been created for Wallower by a friend, suggests gifts including a book on climate change by Al Gore, a Kindle, and--perhaps presciently--a book co-authored by ex-hacker Kevin Mitnick titled ""The Art of Intrusion: The Real Stories Behind the Exploits of Hackers, Intruders and Deceivers.""

Shorter days? New security suites? Yes, it's that time of year again, when most makers of computer security suites implore you to update to the latest version. We've looked at nine new premium suites so far. Some have made only incremental changes, and others were so eager to ditch their dirty bathwater that they almost lost the baby, too.

Note that as other suites get released, we'll be updating this story. And for those of you who like the wayback machine, here's last year's roundup.

So far this year, we've looked at nine premium suites: Panda Global Protection 2012, ZoneAlarm Extreme Security 2012, Bitdefender Total Security 2012, Kaspersky Internet Security 2012, Trend Micro Titanium Maximum Security 2012, Lavasoft Ad-Aware 9.5 Pro Internet Security, AVG Internet Security 2012, ESET Smart Security 5, and Norton Internet Security 2012. There are still a few more suites to come.

In terms of security, so far the new Bitdefender is the newest suite that will keep you safest. It outperformed last year's leader, Norton Internet Security, blocking more malware and viruses, and detecting fewer false positives, than any suite this year. Determining which suite will keep you safest is an imperfect science, especially because CNET uses multiple third-party sources to ensure that our results aren't skewed by a single test. However, Bitdefender consistently scored at the top or among the top four suites tested, and so we're confident in recommending it above all others if security is your only determination.

In terms of system performance, as you can see on the chart below, Norton Internet Security remains the suite with the lightest impact on your performance. (Read more on how CNET Labs tests security programs.) However, this year it under-performed on two key metrics: boot time impact, which is the time you have to wait to use your computer after turning it on; and scan time, the amount of time it takes to run a scan. Bitdefender's impact on start up and shut down times leaves much to be desired, but its effect on your computer as you use it turned out to be minimal.

It's also $10 more than Norton Internet Security, so we strongly advise you check out the free 30-day trial and be sure you're comfortable with the price you'd be paying for the protection and ancillary features you'd be getting.

Overall, we're comfortable at this point with recommending Bitdefender as the best high-end security suite so far this year. That may change as the last few suites get released.

Soluto 1.12.113 beta sees two major new features, crash protection and browser add-on management, form a tripartite attack on problematic computer performance with the program's original feature, boot time management.

(Credit: Soluto, Inc.)

Called ""Heal Crashes"" within the program's main interface, the crash prevention feature takes information that Windows logs but ignores, and uses it to analyze the crash, said Soluto Chief Product Officer Roee Adler. Soluto's information is crowd-sourced, so if it's seen the crash before and has logged a solution, the program will offer one to you even if this is the first time the crash has occurred on your computer. The collection of crash signatures that Soluto is building is called the ""PC Genome"".

""We've been analyzing tens of millions of crashes in the field,"" Adler said. ""Even crashes that occurred before Soluto was installed are logged by Windows, so we pull them in, too."" When Soluto finds a crash solution, it highlights the option so it becomes more visible. Also included in the Soluto interface are links to learning more about the crash and data on how frequently other users experience the same problem.

Adler was quick to point out that he thinks that Soluto is unique, with its combination of in-house engineers and crowd-sourcing. ""We have 20 engineers working on crashes, and there are very few people in the world who can do crash dump analysis, and solve data dump from a crash. We want to credit the people who can do it and crowd-source their solutions,"" he explained. Soluto provides people with both links in the crash interface to research the crash on the Web, and suggest crash solutions themselves.

Heal Crashes appeared to be a functional and versatile tool during testing, quickly scanning previous system crash logs and adding them to its local database. However, it's currently limited by whether your computer is stable. For Windows XP and Vista users, I'd consider it a must-try. For Windows 7 users, though, it depends greatly on whether your system and the programs that run it have been stable. If you're running a Firefox or Chrome beta, for example, there's little utility in learning that they crash because they're betas that are prone to crashing. Still, if you're experiencing stable program crashes, Soluto's solutions should add stability to your wobbly computer.

Lighten Web Browser is the new browser add-on management feature, compatible with the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer. It tells you when an add-on is impinging on your browser's performance and helping you remove add-ons. As with other Soluto components, the program provides in-depth analysis of an add-ons impact on the browser, including helping you uninstall the add-on and letting you know whether other people chose to keep or remove it. It also lets you easily reset your default search provider in case that was altered by another program's installer.

Add-on performance has started to come into focus in a major way, following news that toolbars accounted for the majority of instability in Internet Explorer 8. While IE9 does its own add-on analysis, and informs people when an add-on is slowing down the browser by more than two seconds, it's exceptionally convenient to have a multi-browser, single-serving sized solution.

If you're familiar with Soluto, you'll find the Chop Boot boot-time managing feature was left untouched in this update to the program.

Going forward, Adler said that Soluto will be working on system slowdowns and non-responding windows. He anticipates the program remaining free for personal use after it eventually leaves beta, with the company making a profit from licensing Soluto to businesses.

The program certainly benefits from a clean interface that uses easily understood iconography. Some of it is even a bit humorous, such as the angel wings that appear after a program crash. Interface traditionalists might not like Soluto's look, though, with its border-free, white-space heavy approach. It definitely stands out against the field of translucent-bordered programs, though.

(Credit: Soluto, Inc.)

Overall, it's eminently usable and highly useful for both experienced users and novices. The big unanswered question that only time will answer is whether operating system and hardware makers are getting good enough at improving stability that the program's new core feature of healing crashes comes too late to have a massive impact.",html

Mozilla is taking steps to protect users from programs that install add-ons in Firefox without user permission, citing numerous reasons including security concerns and the desire to make sure that the person using Firefox has ultimate control of the add-ons installed.

Two new features will be making their debut in Firefox 8, currently on the Firefox nightly channel but planned to move to the Aurora developer's build early next week. The first feature automatically disables add-ons added to Firefox by other programs. When you start Firefox after the add-on has been installed, a notification window prompts users to either activate the add-on or ignore it.

The second feature kicks in the first time Firefox runs after upgrading to version 8. It goes through your add-ons and sorts them into two categories: ones you've installed, and add-ons from third-party programs. All active add-ons that you have installed will be kept active, while all third-party add-ons will be de-activated unless you choose to re-activate them. As an additional level of protection against unwanted de-activation, the feature will offer a confirmation list of the add-ons you want killed.

(Credit: Mozilla)

Mozilla said in a blog post announcing the features that it sees 1.5 million add-ons downloaded daily, and noted that while add-ons create new features, they can also hamstring the browser's performance. Not unlike Microsoft taking steps to get users to upgrade beyond Internet Explorer 6, Mozilla appears to be interested in getting people to think about the add-ons they've installed and deactivating or uninstalling the unused ones.

Assuming development goes according to plan, Firefox 8 will reach the stable channel, the broadest base of Firefox users, on or around September 27.",html

Both desktop and Android updates are being released today.

Firefox 9 (download for Windows | Mac | Linux | Android) continues the browser's rapid-release development oscillation, where feature enhancements and performance improvements take the lead in alternating months.

The JavaScript improvement called Type Inference, which Mozilla spent more than a year developing, debuts on the PC version of Firefox. The short version is that sites that heavily rely on JavaScript--like Web apps or sites that render games, video, and 3D graphics--will render much, much faster.

What actually changed is this: A feature in Firefox's SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine, Type Inference creates type information by both monitoring the types of values as the program runs and analyzing the program's code. The type information then gets used during ""just-in-time"" compilation to generate more efficient code, and Mozilla says that major benchmarks like its own Kraken test and Google's V8 show the browser running around 30 percent faster.

On Macs, OS X Lion users will finally see support for two-finger swipe gestures, which sounds more offensive than it is. This simply means that if you've got the latest Mac OS, it'll be easier for you to jump from site to site. The Mac interface has also been tweaked to match the slight visual changes that arrived in Lion, and multiple monitor support in the browser has been improved.

(Credit: Mozilla)

Web developers get some attention in Firefox 9, too. The most important developer changes in Firefox 9 are that sites that run Ajax or download large data sets will load faster, and sites can now display content as it's being downloaded thanks to new support to chunking XHR requests. While a technical term, the upshot of chunking XHR requests is that developers can build Web sites to receive large amounts of data faster, and thus making the site itself faster to load. JavaScript can also be used to detect a browser's Do Not Track preference, the option that tells Web sites not to use cookies to track a person's browsing behavior. A longer list of Web developer changes in Firefox 9 is available.

Firefox's new Android tablet interface makes it to the stable version of the browser, and the interface changes are drastic. As I noted when the new look arrived in the Aurora channel in September, the Back button has moved to the location bar, which has been stretched to the right edge of the screen to put Refresh and Bookmark buttons closer at hand. Tabs have been moved to a hidden menu when in portrait mode, and appear much larger than they have before when they're exposed. There have been some performance gains, too, as Mozilla says that people ought to see faster app load times.

This new look won't be around long, though. Mozilla plans to rebuild its app using native Android code, and the mock-ups show even more changes to the interface. One change that does look like it'll stick around is a new sidebar approach to the Awesome Bar, so that when you tap the location bar, tabs for Bookmarks, Open tabs, History, and Sync appear on the side while you scroll in the middle of the window.

There have also been two big improvements to HTML5 support in Firefox for Android. The browser now supports the Input Tag for cameras, which means that developers can build mobile sites and apps that will take pictures and scan bar codes without leaving Firefox. Mozilla created a demo of the Input Tag here.

The second change supports the HTML5 Form Validation API, for automatic form-field validation. Basically, it will be easier to get the browser to validate typed text.

While the future of Firefox for Android lies in abandoning the current interface for the predicted massive speed gains from native Android code, the PC version of Firefox looks to address ongoing add-on compatibility issues, and give the browser a more seamless automatic update experience.",html

Released a day ahead of schedule because the features were ready, explained a Mozilla representative in an e-mail to CNET, Firefox 17 for Android supports an expansive list of ARM v6 hardware. This means that older but popular phones like the Samsung Galaxy Pro GT-B7510, HTC Status, Motorola XT531, and Motorola Fire XT can now run the alternative browser.

The hardware restrictions are fairly minimal, and appear to include many if not most phones still running Android 2.2. As long as your phone has at least an 800MHz processor and 512MB of RAM, it ought to be able to run the browser.

Other changes to Firefox 17 for Android bring better support for the visually impaired to the browser, as Firefox no longer requires additional configuration to work with the Android 4.2 screen-reading feature TalkBack. When installed on a phone that has TalkBack activated, the browser will automatically start working with the feature, which Mozilla says is a first for Android phones. Explore by Touch and Gesture Navigation are also supported.

Firefox 17 now includes the ""sandbox"" attribute for iFrames, making it a bit more secure; h.264 video hardware and software decoder support in Android 4.0 and above; and rudimentary support for Mozilla Marketplace Web apps.

Just like Google's offerings (Doc and Calendar syncing, and Picasa, as examples), iCloud lets you sync media, apps, music, documents, calendars, and more automatically. It's important to note that Android has had the download and sync features since February of this year.

As usual at Apple's keynote events, Steve Jobs was not the only person on the stage demonstrating the latest and greatest from Apple. Phil Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide product marketing, came up to talk about multitouch gestures on the Mac, for example. Craig Federighi, senior vice president of Apple software, then came up to demo some of the new features of full-screen apps. But when it was time to talk about iCloud, it was Steve Jobs who did the talking. In other words, however you feel about iCloud, it seemed to be the ""main event"" that Apple seemed to be most excited about.

iCloud is Apple's move toward making your most important data and content available on all your devices. If you buy a song on iTunes, it will be automatically pushed immediately to devices under the same account, for example. For more on iTunes and Apple's iTunes Matching features, read Donald Bell's coverage.

Similarly, when you take a photo, your image will immediately become available under your Photo Stream on all devices and desktops. Read more about the new Camera app and iCloud Photo Stream features in Lori Grunin's post.

Beyond those two multimedia additions, you'll also have what Apple calls ""all-access apps."" This means that regardless of what device you used to buy the app, your purchase info will be sent to the cloud and that app can be pushed to all of your devices. If you lose your iPhone or buy a new iOS device, you'll be able to get all your old apps and info onto the new device wirelessly, just like on Android. Many users have complained about the need to always sync on the iPhone (while Android users have had this convenience since February), but with these added iCloud features, it just might be the reason you decide to go with an iPhone on your next upgrade.

Along with all-access apps, you'll have the same type of access to your iBooks. Just like with apps, when you buy a new book, it is first sent to iCloud, then sent to all your iOS devices, desktop, and laptop computers under the same account. As an added bonus, if you're reading an iBook and place a bookmark or highlight text you want to look at later, when you visit the same book on another device you'll be able to pick up reading where you left off, and all your highlighted text and notes will be there.

iCloud will also save and distribute all your documents to all your devices. This means you'll be able to edit a document in any of the iWork apps (Pages, Numbers, and Keynote) and the content will be pushed to your other devices and desktops. Google Docs already has this functionality (as a Web-based offering, you're always working in the cloud), so as far as currently available office apps, Apple has done little new here and you'll initially need to buy the iWork apps to use these functions--a cost not incurred by using current Google offerings. But Apple also announced the availability of the iCloud tools for developers to use in third-party apps, which means that future office apps, work done in other supported specialty apps, and even games will seamlessly sync across all your devices and computers.

A new regular backup feature will send all your data on your iPhone to iCloud once a day. So, beyond your app purchases, iBook reading and bookmarking, and other iCloud features mentioned here, there will also be a daily backup of docs, iTunes music, your calendar, contacts, and app data, so you always know every device has the latest data.

(Credit: Donald Bell/CNET)

In addition to the daily backup, your Mail, Calendar, and Contacts will be backed up to iCloud. Similar to the Google app experience, but on iOS devices, you'll now have all your mail, appointments, and contacts automatically pushed to every device. It even works with Microsoft Exchange server, so Office (Windows or Mac) users can have e-mails automatically pushed to Outlook.

When you're able to set up iCloud this fall, you'll get 5GB of data storage for free and a free @me.com e-mail account.

Overall, it looks like Apple's free iCloud service will make syncing your data and media a painless, wireless task, but Google already offers many of these features on the Android and Google Docs. While many features offered with iCloud mimic what Google Docs already offers, additional features like wireless iOS upgrades, wireless buying and sharing of music and photos, and the ability to keep every device up to date with the latest data, make it an excellent upgrade for iOS users. It will be interesting to see what pitfalls emerge with what will be an enormous amount of traffic initially and if Apple is able to pull it all off when iCloud and iOS 5 become available this fall.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-30686_3-20061956-266.html,"Day 2 of Google I/O: Chrome, Chrome, Chrome",,2018-01-11T17:22:59+00:00,"CNET/James Martin

SAN FRANCISCO--The second day of Google's annual Google I/O developer conference was all about Chrome.

Leading the charge on the news front was the announcement of the first Chromebooks, notebooks that are based on Google's Chrome OS and provide an always-on and always-connected computing experience.

During the press conference following the keynote address on Wedneday, where the first two Chromebooks were introduced, Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of Chrome, emphasized that Chromebooks represent a new model of computing.

""It offers an end-to-end computing experience,"" he said. ""It's very different from a (Microsoft) Windows machine. The always-connected and always-on capability of it offers a totally different experience.""

Samsung and Acer will each be offering Chromebook notebooks starting June 15. The Samsung Chromebook will cost $429 in the U.S. for the Wi-Fi only version and $499 for the 3G version. Acer's Wi-Fi only Chromebook will cost $349.The devices will be available for sale in the U.S. from Amazon and Best Buy.

Google will also be selling these Chromebooks internationally in the U.K., France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, and Italy.

Though the Chromebooks look as if they're pitted against inexpensive Netbooks and even possibly new tablet PCs, the pricing seems expensive given that the devices leverage only Web apps from Google's cloud services. No real software is running on the devices.

As a result, the relatively high price tag for the first Chromebooks has come under fire from some critics.

""It's pretty interesting,"" said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst with Gartner. ""But at these prices, will consumers buy it? At $499, that gets you a pretty capable Netbook or even an iPad.""

The initial Chromebooks are priced similarly to other Netbooks with more functionality, as well as to tablet PCs. But Google's Pichai defended the pricing, saying during the press conference that it's fair, considering the quality components that are in these initial models.

""A good display and processor will cost you about $150 per device,"" he said during the Q&A with reporters. ""And then you have the good trackpads and other quality components. These aren't meant to be cheap computers. They're meant to offer a great experience.""

Google co-founder Sergey Brin chimed in during the press conference with his own thoughts on pricing. He took an informal poll by a show of hands among journalists in the audience to see how many people were using laptops that cost less than $500. Only one person raised her hand, while the majority said their laptops cost more than $800 or $1,000.

""The One Laptop per Child initiative has been super successful,"" he said. ""It may not have been exactly what (Nicholas) Negroponte had hoped for. But it has driven components down in price. So Chromebooks may not be $100, but they're pretty cheap.""

Google also unveiled a subscription program for businesses and schools to get Chromebooks. For businesses the cost is $28 per machine per month. And for schools, the cost is $20 per machine per month. The subscription fee includes the hardware, administrative support, hardware upgrades, and warranty.

Chromebook laptops weren't the only big news to come out of the morning keynote presentation. Google also made several other notable announcements:

The Chrome browser now has 160 million active users. In the past year, Chrome has more than doubled its user base, growing from 70 million active users in 2010 to 160 million users this year. Google has also switched to a six-week release cycle to get features to Web developers sooner. This week, Chrome 12 entered beta.

The Chrome Web Store has also been expanding and is now available in 41 languages along with several more countries.

Google detailed its in-app payment system

The popular mobile game Angry Birds, by Rovio, is also coming to the Chrome Web Store

Android fragmentation affects security patches, too. Instead of waiting to see which devices have been protected against a Dialer app vulnerability discovered earlier this week, Lookout Mobile Security (download) has stepped into the breach with a patch for it today. So far, it's the only known Android security app to block the exploit, but even Lookout's patch requires initial user input.

The vulnerability allowed some Samsung phones to be remotely wiped from the Dialer app, the ""phone"" part of your smartphone. While Samsung pushed out a patch quickly, it's not clear if other phones have also been patched. In its post announcing the fix, Lookout said that just because Google issued a patch for the default Dialer months ago doesn't mean all devices have it.

Dialer attacks are not particularly useful for earning the bad guys money, which is the driving motivation behind most malware these days, Chris Jones, Lookout's vice president of product said during a meeting at the Lookout offices overlooking foggy downtown San Francisco this morning. But a remote phone wipe can be highly disruptive for obvious reasons, so shutting down this vulnerability is important.

Lookout wrote in its blog that Dialer attacks can be triggered by tapping a malicious phone number link that looks legitimate on a Web site; or by opening a Web site that embeds the malicious phone number link as a resource, such as in an iFrame. The second one would cause the link to load automatically, regardless of whether you tap on it.

The updated version of Lookout will scan telephone links before they open, and warn you if the number is malicious. The first time you click on a tel: link, the updated Lookout app will ask you if you'd like to have the link scanned. This requires user input, but you can set it as the default from the pop-up box that asks you if you want to scan the tel: link.

Because the worst-case scenario involving this vulnerability is catastrophic data loss, Lookout has stated that it's important to protect against a Dialer app attack even though there's no known ""in-the-wild"" attack. The company recommends that people concerned about whether their phone is susceptible go to this Web site from their mobile browser.",html

Today's announcements were all about the software -- there was no hardware news at all -- including more features for Messages and Photos, an overhauled Apple Music, and a new name for OS X, which will now support Siri. Cook also praised the 13,000 developers who have created 2 million apps for the App Store, which has racked up 130 billion downloads.

iOS 10

News of iOS 10 dominated nearly half the morning keynote. The update will offer a raft of improvements when it ships this fall, and a public preview will be arrive in July.

Messages. In 2016 tech events, messaging and chatbots are de rigueur. Messages, the most frequently used app on iOS, will give third-party messaging apps a run for their money by adding rich links (complete with images and extracted titles), in-line video, an in-message view of the iPhone camera, bigger emoji, emoji predictions, highlightable words you can emojify with a tap, Bubble Effects to give moods to your messages, dynamic stickers, and invisible ink so recipients can swipe your text for a surprise. You'll be able to send handwritten messages, share drawings, and even display your heartbeat.

Siri. Apple will open its digital assistant to third-party developers, so you'll be able to book rides and control fitness apps, for example, via voice commands.

Better UX. Apple's focusing on streamlining the user experience, such as making screens simpler to access through a touch or a swipe. For example, Raise to Wake will let you tilt up your phone to wake it from sleep mode.

Photos. Because many of us don't bother organizing our iPhone images, Photos will do the job, using face, object, and scene recognition to gather related photos into albums. For example, Photos can automatically create an album of your recent beach vacation, as well as make an album of images with beach scenes. Photos will also make Memory Movies, automatically stitching together related images and video clips, with theme music, titles, and transitions.

QuickType. Apple will apply Siri-like intelligence to the keyboard, using context to predict responses. For example, if someone asked for an email address in an message, QuickType would offer the address as a possible response.

Maps. Maps will become much more helpful, offering proactive suggestions and guidance. For example, Maps will search a calendar event to display a location, and will offer transportation and location suggestions for your destination. Apple will also open Maps up to third-party developers, so, for example, you could search for a place to eat, book a reservation in OpenTable, and request a car from Uber, all from within Maps.

Apple Music. Apple has redesigned its mobile music app, working to make the interface less cluttered and easier to navigate in iOS 10. With a nod Spotify and its personalized song recommendations, Apple is sprucing up Apple Music's For You section to help you discover new music that you'll actually enjoy. Those hoping for news of a more usable iTunes, however, will have to keep waiting.

News. Apple will redesign its News app to better display story sections. Stories will be organized by top, trending, and featured and will be hand-picked by editors. You'll also be able to gather your subscriptions in News.

HomeKit. Improvements will let you more easily control most home tasks -- turning on lights, turning off appliances, answering and unlocking doors -- directly from the HomeKit app on an iPhone or iPad home screen.

Phone. iOS 10 will offer voicemail transcription, spam detection for incoming calls, and the ability to set a preferred communication app in a contact's card.

Notes, Mail, Live Photos, and Safari. Notes will gain collaboration tools so you can create and edit documents live. A Conversation View in Mail will let you scroll from message to message more easily. Live Photos will gain digital video stabilization and become editable. Safari users will enjoy Split View on the iPad for easy multitasking.

OS X is now MacOS

To unify branding across its operating systems, Apple is changing the name of OS X to MacOS, and the next update -- due this fall -- will be called Sierra, for the mountain range in California. A public beta will be available in July.

Apple said it will focus Sierra improvements on three main areas: Continuity, allowing you to seamlessly move across Apple devices to complete tasks; broader iCloud sharing; and simpler user interactions, such as the ability to unlock a Mac with a tethered Apple Watch via Auto Unlock.

Siri. Perhaps the biggest and most hoped-for addition will be a MacOS version of Siri. Apple's intelligent voice assistant will be able to control music, send messages, and act on sophisticated search queries. You will be able to drag and drop Siri search results as well as pin them in Notification Center.

Apple Pay. Another import from iOS, Apple Pay will let you complete a purchase by clicking Pay With Apple Pay on a commerce website and then confirming the purchase on an iPhone or Apple Watch.

iCloud. One seemingly dull feature that won oohs from the crowd: Universal Clipboard, which will let you copy and paste information across your mobile and desktop devices. Other iCloud improvements include the ability to mirror a desktop across devices, and to optimize local storage by moving infrequently used files to the cloud and removing unnecessary files.

Picture-in-picture. Sierra will gain picture-in-picture to display video in a movable window at the push of a button.

App tabs. You will be able to create tabs in native and third-party apps, much as you do with Web browsers, to gather related files together.

WatchOS

The biggest question about the Apple Watch thus far: Is it actually useful? With today's announcement, it just might be. Apple said that the next WatchOS, due this fall, will seriously accelerate launch times for WatchOS apps and make most functions available in fewer taps or swipes.

You will be able to scroll down for canned replies or tap Scribble to draw a response that turns to text.

Handy widgets, such as Weather, can be added to Faces. Your favorite apps can be stored in accessible docks, so you can easily swipe between them.

The new SOS feature enables you to call for emergency services in any country without knowing the exact number.

Exercise enthusiasts will appreciate Activity Sharing, which lets you share your activity rings with family and friends. You can also communicate directly with them in messages within the Activity app.

The new WatchOS is available to preview today, and you can expect the free upgrade in the fall.

TvOS

Apple said Apple TV offerings have grown exponentially, with 1,300 video channels and 6,000 native apps added to TvOS in just seven months.

Among the additions planned for this fall are single sign-on -- sign in once to access all your pay-TV subscriptions and services -- and expanded reach for Siri to find videos by topic.

The TvOS developer's preview is available today, with the final release rolling out to the public in the fall.

Privacy

After going several rounds with the FBI, Apple is still focusing on user privacy. Apple said it uses end-to-end encryption in iMessage, FaceTime, and HomeKit to protect data by making it unreadable by Apple and third parties. The company also said that everything done to identify people, objects, and scenes in Photos and to drive QuickType suggestions happens on the device.

Programming made easy

Finally, Apple said that this fall it will release Swift Playgrounds for the iPad, a learning app to teach kids the basics of programming. The app will offer tutorials and hands-on learning modules for beginning to advanced coding topics for Swift, Apple's modern, open-source programming language.",html

Editor's note: We used Cover It Live for this event, so if you missed the live blog, you can still replay it in the embedded component at the end of this post. Replaying the event will give you all the live updates along with commentary from our readers and CNET reporters. For those of you who just want the basic updates, we've posted an edited transcript below. You can also read our stories about the partnership between Facebook and Skype and Facebook introducing group chats.

Update 10:28 a.m. PT: The social network has tapped Skype for video chat. The partnership will also enable users to import their news feed, send instant messages, comment, and ""like"" all within Skype.

Facebook is holding another one of its news briefings Wednesday and we'll there to bring you the news, live from the company's Palo Alto, Calif., headquarters.

So far there have been murmurs of the company cooking up a number of products, from tablet apps, to new photo-sharing and music-listening services. More recently there's even been talk of video chat service powered by Skype, which Microsoft (a Facebook investor) recently paid $8.5 billion for in a deal back in May.

Co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Reuters last week that the company was planning to ""launch something awesome"" at the event. Whatever it is comes from a 40-person development group from the company's offices in downtown Seattle.

As usual, we'll be using Cover it Live to bring you updates and photos from the event. The event starts at 10 a.m. PT.

Transcript of live blog starts here:

10:14 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): And we're starting everyone. Zuckerberg up @ the podium.

10:15 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): ""Thanks for coming out today,"" Zuckerberg says. ""We've been busy building stuff for the past six months or so."" Today is the start of ""launching season."" Zuckerberg now sharing a story about his neighbor telling him, ""I heard you guys are launching something on the radio today! I hope it's video chat! I want to video chat with my grandson!""

10:17 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Zuckerberg says social networking is at ""an inflection point"" right now. So far it's been about connecting people. ""There's this new way that people are staying connected,"" or ""look how many people are being connected.""

Until the last couple years, people had questions about whether it would be widespread, Zuckerberg says. ""I think that chapter is more or less done at this point.""

10:17 a.m. PT (Rafe Needleman) : Skype just confirmed: https://twitter.com/#!/Skype/status/88656651430801408

10:17 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): ""There's this clear arc, where the world generally believes it is going to be everywhere,"" and that it's only a matter of time before it's in the billions.

10:18 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Now we're seeing a screen capture of all the social connections around the world (lots of threads between countries).

Zuckerberg says the trend in the next 5 years is not about the number of connections, but what you can build on top of it.

10:19-10:20 a.m. PT (Rafe Needleman) : Microsoft now owns Skype, as well as a small piece (1.6%) of Facebook. Although I doubt that Microsoft has much to do with this deal. Correction: MS still awaiting approval on Skype buy

10:20 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Zuckerberg says companies that are best in class with games, music, communications, search want to know how to introduce social bits to their products. ""That's some of what we have to talk about today,"" Zuckerberg says.

But how to measure? If last few years have been about user growth and active users. The next five years is not going to be about that metric. Zuckerberg says you measure it by amount of value people are getting, time spent, number of apps, driving the economy. ""We see a version of that with sharing on Facebook as well.""

10:21-10:23 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Zuckerberg says the rate of people sharing has gone way, way up. Growing at an exponential rate.

Amount of stuff they share is about twice of what they'd be sharing a year ago. That trend is expected to keep doubling for the next two years.

Zuckerberg notes that people are bad at understanding exponential growth. Using an example of folding a piece of paper on itself 50 times. It goes to the moon and back more than 10 times. ""It's a small base, doubling many times.""

750 million users confirmed, Zuckerberg says was not reported because the company doesn't think that's a metric worth tracking.

10:23-10:24 a.m. PT (Rafe Needleman) : Skype will be a client for Facebook. Will be able to view Facebook stream in Skype in 5.3. In 5.5, now in open beta, you can send chat messages to Facebook users. I'm only partially paying attention to Zuck's math lesson.

10:24-10:25 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): More impressive, Zuckerberg says, is the ramp up in sharing per user. Now showing us a fancy ""log normalized"" graph demoing Moore's Law, with processor speeds going up year by year. There's a connection here, Zuckerberg says. Sharing has hit similar growth milestones with features like profiles, photos, newsfeed, platform apps, comment likes, the like button, groups and messages.

10:25 a.m. PT (Rafe Needleman) : It looks like Facebook/Skype integration is Windows only today. I'm on a Mac at the moment and can't find download links. If you're on Windows, though, give it a spin here: http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/features/allfeatures/facebook/

10:26 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Originally people were sharing about .1 things per day in 2004, with it growing with photos, followed by status updates on the news feed.

TL;DR here: We add more stuff and you share more stuff.

Zuckerberg says we're ""at the elbow of the curve."" Whatever gets built from here on out are going to make that sharing growth exponential, he says.

James Martin/CNET

10:27 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Zuckerberg says 4 billion things are shared every day. ""The stuff we're going to share today doesn't even fit into that 4 billion,"" Zuckerberg says. Today we're hearing about private communication. That's group chat, a new chat design, and video calling.

James Martin/CNET

10:28 a.m. PT (Rafe Needleman) : Three new things today:

* group chat

* new design

* video calling

10:28 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Zuckerberg says most users just accept friend requests vs. sending them out. Groups has helped out with that, with people not having to do much of the leg work. ""We just want to make it so you can do ad-hoc chat as well."" It's something a lot of people have asked for, Zuckerberg says.

James Martin/CNET

10:30 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Zuckerberg says that if people have the wide-screen width to see a buddy list, and Facebook on the same screen, that's the way to go.

Video calling, ""we're doing this with Skype,"" Zuckerberg says. It's ""symbolic"" of how the company is going to do things from here on out, he says.

10:30 a.m. PT (Rafe Needleman) : So, a correction, you don't need Skype, apparently, to do video chat. Can do it from the Facebook site itself via a small plug-in.

10:30 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Plug-in for the video chat tech takes about 10-20 seconds to download, Zuckerberg says. A demo is coming up shortly.

10:30 a.m. PT (Rafe Needleman) : Again the in-Facebook link for video calling is: https://www.facebook.com/videocalling

James Martin/CNET

10:31-10:33 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): ""We're using the best technology that's out there for video chat, with the best social infrastructure that's out there,"" Zuckerberg says.

Zuckerberg says the approach of partnering with ""best in class"" companies ends up with a better product, and that it's a different approach from companies that try to build everything in-house.

Facebook is the infrastructure, enabling people to build cool software on top of it, Zuckerberg says.

Peter, group chat's product manager up now. He says 50 percent are actively using groups. Says that people needed an easier way to start those conversations with ad-hoc groups.

10:33 a.m. PT (Rafe Needleman) : Peter from Facebook is equating high use numbers with ""people love it."" Very Jobsian.

10:34 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): The example there is one-click options to add friends to chat without having to make a group. If they're online they see it right away. If they're offline, they get a summary later on. That's coming out today.

Also new: a redesign of the chat design. Before it's been out of the way (on the left). Now it will sit on the right-hand side of the page, similar to a big buddy list. The people you message the most show up there.

10:35 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): The chat window itself has also been tweaked to add a little video button, akin to Google Talk.

Now we're getting a demo from Phillip, an engineer from the company's Seattle office, who's going to give us a demo of video calling.

10:35 a.m. PT (Rafe Needleman) : Group Chat is like Google+ Hangout in text, I guess. (Hangout also has a chat window.)

10:36-10:37 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): If your friend is online, you can start a video call. It connects immediately, and hovers on top of the profile in a slick little lightbox. Demo time...

Demo starting out from a text chat. Phillip hits the video chat button, and it connects (complete with a ""Facebook + Skype"" logo).

James Martin/CNET

To the depths of the Seattle office.

James Martin/CNET

10:38-10:39 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Phillip says we should focus on ""how did that feel?"" Connecting to someone else right from the page with no technical knowledge, no new accounts. ""This is by far the easiest way to get connected with video.""

The big hurdle, Phillip says, is the download. First time use gets a little ""do you want to download this?"" pop-up, followed by a Java applet. 20 seconds later you have it installed, and are two clicks away from video chat.

Tony Bates, CEO of Skype, up on stage now to talk about the partnership.

10:40 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): ""Really gratifying to see the product, and to have this available on the leading social network out there,"" Bates says.

James Martin/CNET

Bates says the company is averaging 300 million minutes of video a month, and 50 percent of all traffic is video calling.

10:42 a.m. PT (Rafe Needleman) : Video calling is now table stakes for social products. Google+'s GROUP video chat is a big step forward.

10:42 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Bates says partnership started with taking feeds, contacts and integrating IM. ""Technology itself is tough,"" Bates says. It's not at a billion yet, but it will be eventually, he notes.

Bates says paid components will make their way into it. (Think Skype Out here.)

James Martin/CNET

10:43-10:44 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Zuckerberg back up now, says he's wrapping it up, then on to Q&A. To wrap, group chat, a new design of the chat sidebar, and video calling powered by Skype.

Zuckerberg says we're going to see a lot more of these things in the next few months and years. Some of it will be big companies like Skype, and others will be people building on top of the company's platform. Now onto Q&A...

10:45 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Q (via Ben Parr of Mashable): Is group video chat in the future? What do you think of Google hangouts?

A: (Zuckerberg) Today we're doing 1 on 1. We've been working on Skype before Bates was there. Now Skype is a part of Microsoft, and we have a longstanding relationship with Microsoft. I wouldn't rule anything out. I also wouldn't undersell the value of what we have today. The vast majority of video chat out there is 1 on 1.

10:47 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Bates says the 1 on 1 bit is an awesome start, and we'll continue to build exciting things.

Zuckerberg says on Google +: We've all only spent a little bit of time on the service. The last 5 years have been about connecting people, and the next 5 years are about connecting the apps. What you're going to see is people building social networking into their apps. Netflix is a good example of wanting to build social stuff. Now that there's social infrastructure out there, people are going to do that. There's going to be a hybrid, with some people building their own. I view this as validation of how this is going to play out over the next 5 years.

10:49 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Q: Do you worry about people skipping direct Skype integration from an app?

A: Bates: No. We set a goal of hitting over a billion, and this can get us there. We want to be ubiquitous.

James Martin/CNET

Q: Larry Magid of CBS: How do we accept a video chat request? Can it be unintentional?

A: Zuckerberg: You have to accept it. You will get a ring as if your phone (or computer) is ringing. Box gives you accept, or click out option. The camera doesn't turn on until you accept it.

10:51 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Q: CNBC: What's in it for Skype financially? You guys get most of your money with Skype Out. I don't see how this leads to that.

A: Bates: We are talking about futures. I did mention paid products, but today is all about reach.

Q: Rafe (of CNET): Can you talk about these features with mobile features? (Tablets and smartphones)

A: Zuckerberg: Video calling is not live for mobile (yet), chat redesign for mobile doesn't have wide screens (yet), and group chat works. One of the things that's unique about our messaging, is that when you send a message, the interface is the same as your mailbox. Most of these are Web features?

Q: When video on mobile?

A: Zuckerberg: We'll start working on it tomorrow.

10:53 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Q: What does Facebook do to handle the data load?

A: Zuckerberg: We're on the trend now where we're probably going to be building more of our own vs. leasing. One of the innovations of Skype is that it's all peer to peer (P2P). That part of the app is built by Skype. The reason it's so built up is that they had a way of building video chat that's low bandwidth.

Q: Rich from Bloomberg: What's the overlap of Facebook and Skype users?

A: Bates: We don't necessarily track those numbers.

James Martin/CNET

10:53 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Q (from AFP): Is there any revenue sharing? What about the Microsoft relationship here?

A: Zuckerberg: There are no economic terms here, it's the free service. But we're in the process of finding out what to do next. We took a turn to do this inside Facbook, and we've already got a rollout of features we want to add. We'll figure that out, Zuckerberg says.

Re: Microsoft, Zuckerberg says we've got a great relationship. Now that Skype's owned by Microsoft, there's a sense of stability, Zuckerberg says. Bates points out that the deal with Microsoft has not closed yet.

Zuckerberg: We have everything that we wanted to do in line before the Skype acquisition.

10:57 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Q: (via Altimeter group): What's happening with group and friend management over time with all this sharing?

A: Zuckerberg: If this doubling keeps happening 10 years from now, they'll be sharing 1024 times as many things as they are now. There are a few ways that can play out:

1) Proliferation of apps. More social experiences are going to happen.

2) Mobile. Instead of doing this with a computer, you'll be able to do it on mobile devices.

3) Social norms, the sociology behind how sharing develops.

10:58-10:59 a.m. PT (Josh Lowensohn): Zuckerberg: Even just accepting friends, a huge majority of users will only get involved in the system when enough of the people have asked them to be friends that they get sucked in.

Zuckerberg: The trend of these small groups being the thing that's driving the sharing is not where things are going.

And that's a wrap. Thanks for joining us everyone.

It's recently been updated, and if you haven't checked it out lately, now's the time. It's stunning.

The plug-in, which works in Internet Explorer, Firefox, Flock, and Safari (where it's a bit limited), lets you create a moving wall of images where you'd otherwise just see your Web app's more static display of pictures. Launching the viewer is just a matter of clicking a new ""play"" icon that appears on images when you're on a PicLens-supported site.

You can fling the wall backwards and forward to see images in the list, zoom in to full-screen versions of files with a double-click, or start a slideshow. It's a very Mac-like experience.

You also get a search bar in the viewer, which can scan for tagged images on Google, Yahoo, Flickr, PhotoBucket, SmugMug, and DeviantArt. The plug-in itself recognizes images from more sites, including Facebook, MySpace, Bebo, Picassa Web Albums, and AOL Images.

I use it to keep my kid entertained (a slideshow of helicopters will quiet him right down). It really is a better experience than the standard search, view, and slideshow experience you usually get.

There's no embeddable version of the PicLens view yet. I'd like to see that.

CoolIris, which makes PicLens, is nicely funded by Kleiner-Perkins, and as yet has no system to make money from the service. Expect ads in the system to come once the user base has grown. Until then, you can enjoy this sweet product without commercial interruption.",html

More than one person can now use Chrome and keep personal data separate from other users on the same computer, thanks to today's update to Google's browser.

Google Chrome 16.0.912.63 stable for Windows (download), Mac (download), Linux (download), and Chrome Frame also adds an option to sync your Omnibox History, and it includes a number of security fixes.

Multiple-user support is similar to Chrome's Sync feature, but it's more of a complementary feature than a must-use. Sync allows you to always have access to the same bookmarks, history, themes, and preferences. Multi-user support allows you to share a computer and maintain separate identities without logging out of the operating system. This could be useful for single-computer households or small businesses, although it potentially means that Chromebook users will have two ways to switch profiles.

Creating a new profile first requires signing into Chrome, via the Wrench menu's new ""Sign into Chrome"" option. Then, to add a new user, you must go back to the Wrench, choose Options (Mac users select Preferences,) then Personal Stuff, and finally ""Add new user."" This will open a new Chrome window, and from here the new user must repeat the ""Sign into Chrome"" procedure. The new user can also go to the Personal Stuff menu in the new window and change the user name and icon.

Chrome will open separate windows when switching between each profile.

Google cautions in its blog post announcing the feature that the multi-user profile support is not intended to secure your private data against other users. That means although your synced data might be secured on the server, if you're logged in to Chrome with multiple profiles, anybody can switch profiles and access your personal ""stuff,"" as Google likes to call it. This is far less secure than forcing people to re-enter passwords before each opening of a second profile.

Along with the multiple profile support, Chrome 16 now lets adventurous types sync open tabs. You have to go through the about:flags config screen to enable it, but it does indicate that this long-missing sync option is getting close to being ready for stable Chrome users.

Other improvements in Chrome 16 are mainly security fixes, including six labeled ""high."" There were no security fixes in this release marked ""critical."" Check out the Chrome changelog published by Google.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20029284-264.html,Mozilla offers do-not-track tool to thwart ads,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Mozilla, acting on a U.S. Federal Trade Commission proposal, has offered a detailed mechanism by which Firefox and other Web browsers could prevent Web pages from tracking people's online behavior for advertising purposes.

With Mozilla's do-not-track technology, network data packets from the browser would signal to a Web site that a person doesn't wished to be tracked. Then comes the tricky part: getting Web site operators to cooperate.

Alex Fowler, Mozilla's global privacy and public policy leader, said that with the mechanism, the browser would alert a Web site during basic communications that use the Web's Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). He also acknowledged that getting Web sites to cooperate is a crucial difficulty in getting the system to work:

As the first of many steps, we are proposing a feature that allows users to set a browser preference that will broadcast their desire to opt-out of third party, advertising-based tracking by transmitting a Do Not Track HTTP header with every click or page view in Firefox. When the feature is enabled and users turn it on, Web sites will be told by Firefox that a user would like to opt-out of OBA [online behavioral advertising]. We believe the header-based approach has the potential to be better for the Web in the long run because it is a clearer and more universal opt-out mechanism than cookies or blacklists... The advantages to the header technique are that it is less complex and simple to locate and use, it is more persistent than cookie-based solutions, and it doesn't rely on user's finding and loading lists of ad networks and advertisers to work... The challenge with adding this to the header is that it requires both browsers and sites to implement it to be fully effective. Mozilla recognizes the chicken and egg problem and we are taking the step of proposing that this feature be considered for upcoming releases of Firefox.

Mozilla

Mozilla has long had privacy as part of its mission to empower users of the Internet. In practice, privacy remains a broad, thorny problem, however; what one person sees as corporate intrusiveness another can see as a way to offer genuinely relevant ads.

Mozilla doesn't appear to be acting alone. Today, ""Google is expected to announced a privacy tool called 'Keep My Opt-Outs' that enables users to permanently opt out of ad -targeting from dozens of companies,"" The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday, citing an unnamed source.

The FTC proposed a Do Not Track mechanism last year (click for PDF).

""While some industry members have taken positive steps toward improving consumer control, there are several concerns about existing consumer choice mechanisms,"" the FTC said. Among them, ""industry efforts to implement choice on a widespread basis have fallen short,"" consumers aren't generally aware of the technology when it's available, and it can be hard to use.

""Given these limitations, [FTC] staff supports a more uniform and comprehensive consumer choice mechanism for online behavioral advertising, sometimes referred to as 'Do Not Track,' the report said. ""Such a universal mechanism could be accomplished by legislation or potentially through robust, enforceable self-regulation.""

http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-10260313-12.html,"Safari 4 fast, but only minor tweaks from beta","June,Pm,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Updated, June 17: The sandboxing of plug-ins, such as Flash, in Safari 4 will be limited to users running Mac OS X 10.6, which will be available this fall. The feature is currently not available, nor will it be available to Windows users. Windows users should also note that changing the default search provider is limited to either Google or Yahoo.

The public version of Safari 4 was released Monday amid all the iPhone noise at WWDC, and Apple confirmed what those who played around with the beta version already knew: Safari is now a serious browser for serious Windows users, and its position on Macs has been bolstered.

You can download Safari 4 for Windows and Mac from CNET Download.com.

If you're unfamiliar with Safari 4, I strongly recommend checking out Stephen Shankland's analysis of the Safari beta version that was released in January. The biggest overall changes are the graphics improvements, including the new interface and the new JavaScript engine called Nitro, but since the beta little else is dramatically different.

Users of Safari 3 will be hard-pressed to not notice that the interface is completely new, with a look and feel much more in line with the other major Webkit-based browser, Google Chrome. The browser launches with the menu bar, tab bar, and status bar all hidden, presenting you with the location bar, bookmark bar, and the slick Top Sites interface. Top Sites is essentially Opera's Speed Dial feature, presenting your most commonly visited Web sites, with a Cover Flow-style skin. The black background, curvature, and reflective window bottom make this the most professional-looking Web browser around. A blue star and an upturned corner indicate that a site has been updated since your last visit to it. Tap the Edit button in the bottom left corner to remove a site or pin a site permanently to Top Sites.

One major change to the interface from the beta involves tabs. In the beta, Apple experimented with a Chrome-style ""tabs-on-top"" that it has abandoned in the public release. The font for the tabs was often hard to read, and made Safari look excessively like Chrome. The new tab style now looks much like the old tab style.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Cover Flow is now available as a graphic way to browse your bookmarks and history, however, if you've got a somewhat older computer you still won't be able to use any of these graphics improvements.

Another new change for Mac users in Snow Leopard will be the sandboxing of browser crashes caused by plug-ins such as Flash and Shockwave. The page that they're on will continue to function, and you can reactivate the plug-in by reloading the page.

Safari 4 is also the first nonbeta browser to fully complete the Acid3 Web standards compliance test.

The URL bar does feature ""smart"" surfing, but only for including your history and bookmarks--much like Internet Explorer. Chrome and Firefox remain the only browsers to default to Google's ""feeling lucky"" style of searching from the location bar.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Apple's big claim with Safari is that it's the fastest browser on the market, and Apple just might be right on that count. On an Intel Core Duo T400 ThinkPad, with 3GB of RAM and a 2.53GHz processor, I ran both Webkit's SunSpider JavaScript test and Mozilla's Dromaeo test on Firefox 3.5 Preview, Google Chrome 2, and Safari 4. Safari came out on top in Dromaeo by a long shot, but Chrome eked by in SunSpider.

For the SunSpider test, Chrome hit 597.0 milliseconds, while Safari scored 620.4 ms and Firefox comparatively chugged along at 952.2 ms. On Dromaeo, Safari reached 175.06 runs per second, Chrome managed 67.92 runs/s, and Firefox came in last again at 48.48 runs/s. However, Chrome only led in two categories, and it tied both with Safari. Safari definitively led in 36 tests, and Firefox led in 12.

Keeping in mind that although these tests are affected by background computer processes, your hardware, and other factors, Safari is definitely one of the fastest browsers out there. However, it still lacks extensions, and for many Firefox users that's enough to keep them from switching. Even Internet Explorer supports some form of extensibility with its Web Slices and Accelerators.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Safari is still a RAM-devouring beast, too. With two tabs open, one to Dromaeo and one to SunSpider, it was using a shocking amount of RAM--more than 500MB after running both tests. Google Chrome consumed about 75MB of RAM across the same two sites under the same circumstances, while Firefox required 120MB.

With about 8.5 percent of the browser market, it's clear that Apple is positioning Safari as more than a developer's tool on Windows, and that its successes at building a faster JavaScript engine should be taken seriously even with its other drawbacks.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20009313-264.html,Firefox's Jetpack extensions get 2010 goal,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Mozilla

Mozilla had to restart an effort to overhaul Firefox's extension technology, but the Jetpack reboot is steadily coming together.

Mozilla has released five beta versions of the Jetpack Software Developer Kit, a package that puts a friendly face on Firefox's inner workings so that extensions can do things such as open new tabs, add menu items, and modify Web pages. And the latest schedule was announced this week: its goal is to release Jetpack 1.0 by the end of 2010.

""We've been working on the SDK for almost a year now (and the Jetpack project as a whole for over a year), and we've done a bunch of great work that we should get into the hands of developers who could benefit from it,"" said Mozilla Jetpack team member Myk Melez in a mailing list message.

Jetpack takes a page from the Google Chrome playbook by letting programmers write extensions that use Web technologies such as HTML and JavaScript. That's the same direction Apple went with its new Safari 5 extensions, too.

In contrast, Firefox extensions today use the powerful but complicated XUL technology. Mozilla hopes Jetpack will bring more programmers by making it easier, increase extension compatibility from one Firefox release to the next, and help eliminate the need to restart Firefox when an extension is installed or updated.

As Jetpack matures, the Web-based extension development tool called Flightdeck is growing more important for those who prefer its approach to the Jetpack SDK software running on their computers.

""It is becoming increasingly clear that FlightDeck will be a key component in the success of the project, just as important as the SDK, and we should treat it as such, devoting the same kind of time and energy to planning and driving its development, designing its interface and capabilities, and developing its functionality,"" Melez said in another mailing list message.

Jetpack isn't timed specifically to be released with Firefox 4, which brings better performance, a new user interface, and the new HTML5 parser. However, Jetpack is designed to take advantage of some new Firefox 4 features, Mozilla said.

For a tentative look at what's next for Jetpack, see the plans for Jetpack 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8.

One complication of Jetpack is that it integrates with Electrolysis, a Mozilla project to separate elements of Firefox into separate memory regions to help with performance and security. Jetpack extensions are designed to run in these separate partitions, but Electrolysis is a pretty deep and technical change to the browser's development.

The first Electrolysis element, out-of-process plug-ins, arrived last week with Firefox 3.6.4, but Mozilla quickly released the 3.6.6 update because older machines would show the Flash Player plug-in to have crashed when in fact a slower computer was just bogged down in processing.",html

The people behind the new add-on for Firefox called Cocoon (download) want to cut through debate by serving the entire Web to you via proxy. (Cocoon is also available at GetCocoon.com.)

(Credit: Cocoon)

Made by Santa Barbara, Calif., start-up Virtual World Computing, Cocoon's goal is to put the Internet on a server to prevent individual users from having to touch it, Cocoon Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Jeff Bermant said in an interview today at CNET's San Francisco offices. The add-on, which has about 4,000 users since it entered into private beta 18 months ago, creates a safe state in which the user can browse the Internet by forcing all interactions between the computer in front of you and the Internet to occur over protected SSL connections to Cocoon's servers. Those servers, in turn, are guarded by Security-Enhanced Linux, which was developed by the United States' National Security Agency.

Cocoon opened its beta to the public in January of this year.

Cocoon installs as a toolbar just below the location bar in Firefox 4, although the add-on supports the browser back to Firefox 3.6. You can turn it on or off using the universal power button icon on the left of the toolbar, or ""pause"" Cocoon lock/unlock button that's next to it. Settings are available from a hard-to-see drop-down arrow just next to the lock button.

On the right are buttons for your Cocoon history, mailslots, and help. Next to those are real-time site-function buttons, so you can bookmark sites on the fly with the thumbtack--similar to the bookmark star in other browsers--or jot down a note attached to the site that only you can see using the notepad icon.

When running Cocoon, the browser will open into Private Browsing mode, although you can switch back to normal mode while still using Cocoon. It will also redirect your Home button to the cocoon:home site, and it installs a Cocoon toolbar as well as Cocoon-specific buttons on the Firefox add-on bar. Note that Cocoon doesn't work with the Google toolbar because of the competing interests of Google search and Cocoon's emphasis on privacy.

Cocoon's features are laudable, the most important being the subtlest: whatever you're looking at in Firefox with Cocoon is being shown to you remotely. You can test this after installing Cocoon by checking your IP address with Cocoon on, and then again with it off: you will see two different addresses, which means that your Internet connection is being routed through Cocoon's servers.

One of the side benefits of this, said Bermant, is that Netflix users will be able to watch streaming content from outside the United States since Cocoon's servers are in the U.S., and Netflix blocks streaming content to IP addresses that indicate a non-U.S. server.

All your personal browsing data is stored in the cloud and encrypted, so only the user can access it, and you can view it only over a secure connection. This is similar to how LastPass functions. All your interactions with the Web are opt-in, not opt-out, so that your privacy gets elevated above all other concerns.

Another excellent feature in Cocoon is that it comes with an unlimited number of on-demand e-mail ""mailslots"" are provided to help you keep your primary e-mail address private. If you've installed Cocoon, you can see how it works by navigating to any site that requires an e-mail address to log in, such as Twitter, Facebook, or Gmail. If Cocoon has been activated, the mailslots feature will ask you if you want to create a new e-mail address to register a new account for that site.

Cocoon Chief Technical Officer and co-founder Brian Fox added that the mailslots function like traditional brick-and-mortar mail drops. ""You can not send e-mail from a Cocoon e-mail, but you can forward it to a Gmail account, for example,"" he said.

(Credit: Cocoon)

There's anti-cookie tracking that prevents advertisers from stalking you as you jump from one Web site to the next, much like Internet Explorer's tracking protection. Cocoon also incorporates support for Mozilla's new ""Do Not Track"", although Bermant remains skeptical of its effectiveness because, he said, ""It requires advertisers to play nice, and they've never done that."" Fox said that Cocoon uses ClamAV for its core antivirus engine, which it uses as part of its protection mechanisms.

Since you're browsing remotely, threats like cross-site scripting attacks and drive-by downloads are blocked. You are still vulnerable to social engineering, however, and short of full-frontal lobotomies, there's little to be done about that besides education and awareness.

Cocoon also comes with a note-taking feature that allows you to type up notes on Web sites as you visit them.

Bermant and Fox have big plans for Cocoon. They want to include features such as browser history and settings importation; implement granular controls for better whitelisting and blacklisting; and provide some level of parental controls. A version of Cocoon for Internet Explorer 9 is in the works. They're also looking at small businesses, anticipating interest from companies that want to strike a better balance between privacy and Web access. Fox noted that mobility is likely to play a major role in Cocoon's future, too. ""Security and privacy are two important aspects of mobile browising,"" he said, ""And they are sorely lacking.""

Cocoon looks like a serious contender for one of the best add-ons of the year. It's a smart and effective tool, easy to toggle on or off, and plugs nearly all of the security holes the average user will encounter. The big hang-up, however, is price, and that many users simply do not pay for add-ons.

Right now, Cocoon is available as a free trial for the first 30 days of use. After that, it costs $6.95 per month, or $55.00 for a one-year subscription, a 35 percent discount. Bermant and Fox say that ""a freemium option is not off the table"". As important as security is, and as affordable as $55 per year sounds, it's hard to imagine widespread adoption of Cocoon's safety wrapping until it's made more accessible.",html

Apple unveiled more compact versions of its iPhone and iPad Pro, plus new watchbands and updates to iOS and TVOS.

iPhone SE

The new 4-inch iPhone SE is a replacement for Apple's 4-inch iPhone 5S, which Apple released in 2013. Despite the success of its larger 4.7- and 5.5-inch iPhones, Apple said the smaller model remains popular, especially with first-time buyers -- 30 million 4-inch iPhones were sold in 2015.

On the outside, the SE looks similar to the iPhone 5S, but on the inside, it's much closer to the iPhone 6S. The SE sports the latest Apple A9 chip and M9 motion coprocessor found in the larger phones, comes with a 12-megapixel iSight camera, and can capture Live Photos and 4K video. It handles Apple Pay via TouchID and an NFC chip and supports the 802.11ac wireless standard for speedy connections. Available in silver, gold, space gray, and rose gold, the 16GB model will cost $399, and the 64GB model will go for $499. You can order today, and the phone starts shipping March 31.

iPad Pro

The new 9.7-inch iPad Pro may be small, weighing less than one pound, but it is feature packed. Like the broad-beamed 12.9-inch iPad Pro Apple released last fall, the smaller Pro employs the fastest-ever 64-bit A9X chip and M9 coprocessor.

The display has a lot to recommend it: lower reflectivity, greater brightness and color saturation, and True Tone Display, which senses the color temperature of ambient light and adjusts to match. So you won't see the same tone at the beach as you do at the coffee shop, making for easier viewing and reading.

The smaller iPad Pro offers four speakers for improved sound and a back-facing 12-megapixel iSight camera (up from 8 megapixels in the larger iPad Pro), which can capture 4K video and Live Photos. The front-facing 5-megapixel FaceTime HD camera now incorporates Retina Flash. The True Tone flash feature makes skin tones lucid no matter how awful the lighting.

A Smart Connector pairs with a new Smart Keyboard with a smaller form factor. The new iPad works with the Apple Pencil and -- if you feel like going hands free -- Hey Siri. Prices start at $599 for the 32GB model and go up to $749 for 128GB and $899 for 256GB. You can order starting March 24 for shipment on March 31.

iOS 9.3

iOS 9 is already running on 80 percent of active devices, and now 9.3 offers promising enhancements that should encourage more iPhone and iPad users to upgrade. Night Shift wants to make evening browsing easier on your eyes and better for your sleep. It determines when the sun has gone down (using your device's clock and geolocation) and then shifts screen colors to the warmer end of the spectrum. In the morning, the display returns to your regular settings.

The update also lets you lock Notes items behind Touch ID and password protection. New CarPlay capabilities for Apple Maps help you find gas, parking, restaurants, coffee, and other locations with a tap.

Native apps are also vastly improved. Health, which now receives data from 2,500 apps, has added app suggestions for new ways get data to your dashboard. The News app has added Top Stories to make it easier to stay on top of current news. Apple Music has added New and For You to help you discover new music.

Apple Watch

Saying a third of Apple Watch wearers regularly change bands, Apple CEO Tim Cook rolled out its spring lineup, including woven nylon bands in a variety of colors, new sports and leather bands, and a Milanese loop.

Apple dropped the price of the most affordable 38mm Sport Watch to $299, down from $349.

Apple TV

An update to TVOS out today lets you organize apps into folders. You can also dictate to Apple TV, and Siri can interact with the App Store. You can also access your iCloud Photo Library.

Personal privacy and health

Cook kicked off the event with a brief celebration of Apple's 40th anniversary on April 1 and then made an ardent defense of Apple's commitment to personal privacy. He said that Apple has more than 1 billion devices in use around the world, and with that breadth comes a duty to help customers guard their information. ""We have a responsibility to help you protect your data,"" Cook said. ""We owe it to our customers and to our country. We will not shrink from this responsibility.""

Apple also highlighted how extensively its ResearchKit tools are being used in medical research, noting that the largest Parkinson's study in history is taking advantage of ResearchKit. A new medical tool, CareKit, will allow researchers to create apps that support patients during recovery or following medical events. Apple said it will be open source and available in April.

El Capitan

Outside of the event, Apple pushed out an update to El Capitan, OS X 10.11.4. The update lets users view Live Photos through the Messages app and password-protect Notes files.

One-time Skype competitor Qik has released its latest app for video communications: Qik Video Connect for iPhone. The new program expands on Qik's work with video calling and broadcast.

The app offers two-way video calls, and lets you record video mail. Qik's live broadcasting skill is present in the feature that lets you post a live link to Facebook and Twitter if you'd like, so friends can watch in real time.

Taking the video theme one step further, Qik Video Connect can create a newsfeed so you can watch friends' videos from the iPhone. It works over 3G, 4G speeds, and Wi-Fi, although the latter may offer the most reliable support.

The app comes in two pricing tiers. The ""plus"" version for $2.99 adds seven real-time effects and filters, similar to the Qik Video Camera Pro app that's already been available in the App Store. It also includes video editing tools and support for high-def video quality. The plus version of the app is available for the iPhone and fourth-generation iPod Touch with iOS 4.0 or later. A Qik spokesperson told CNET this morning that the free version is awaiting Apple's approval.

Although Qik is now part of the Skype family of consumer products, it's interesting that Skype is letting Qik build its original name without rolling it into the Skype brand--at least for now.

Not soon enough, if Lenovo's Superfish software scandal is any indication.

From September to January, Lenovo shipped more than two dozen laptop models with Superfish software that inserted its own ads in Web search results. (It's widely estimated that means millions of computers, though the company hasn't gone into detail.) More than that, Superfish exposed the laptops and their Internet traffic to hackers in a way security experts have described as egregious and easily exploitable.

Lenovo's chief technology executive claimed the company was just trying to improve the user experience. ""Our teams did not understand the significant security problem that [Superfish] presented,"" Peter Hortensius said Tuesday. ""We're desperate to understand why we missed that."" The company on Friday issued a statement pledging to reform its ways.

Superfish, too, pleaded ignorance. Founder and CEO Adi Pinhas blamed a small Israeli startup called Komodia. It's Komodia's software that allowed Superfish to decode Internet traffic and insert ads. Komodia did not respond to a request for comment, but in a 2009 blog, CEO Barak Weichselbaum detailed working on a security program designed to hijack secure Internet traffic.

Lenovo's Superfish debacle highlights a growing problem in the software world: As more software components are outsourced, consumers are placed at greater risk than ever before. Software used by billions of consumers and businesses almost always relies on components made by development companies far removed from the final product, each trusting the other to do their due diligence. Few are, however, and that's putting you at risk, experts say.

Imagine that software is a jigsaw puzzle, with everyone from at-home hobbyists to multinational conglomerates supplying pieces they trust to be well-made, said Herb Lin, a senior researcher for cyber policy at Stanford University's Hoover Institute. The problem is they are ""too trusting"" of their partners, he said.

""Testing is known to not be sufficient,"" said Lin. ""The usual way of vetting software is that I give you a specification and you give me back a program,"" he said. ""I then test it to see if it meets those particular specs. But it's only a part of a program, and it hasn't been tested with all [the other] components."" The smaller software component may even work perfectly until it's built into a larger program or app, at which point the flaw gets introduced.

Third-party software havoc

Holes made by third-party software that are ripe for exploitation by hackers go far beyond Lenovo. Security researchers last year discovered major vulnerabilities in two widely used open-source software tools, dubbing the flaws Heartbleed and Shellshock. Although they were accidentally introduced, they had survived for decades because companies trusted that the small teams of volunteers developing the software had thoroughly checked the software.

There's also the intentional security hole the National Security Agency is accused of inserting into a tool made by the RSA Corporation that scrambles user data to protect it. It's highly unlikely companies would have paid RSA to protect their data had they known, and RSA denies that it knew about it.

To be sure, Lenovo's Hortensius said his company has taken steps to ensure few users can still run into Superfish. But it was only after security experts began howling about Superfish's behavior that some security programs -- from Microsoft, Symantec and McAfee -- detected and removed the software.

A matter of trust

To keep its position atop the global PC market, Lenovo has vowed to stop including unnecessary additional programs in its PCs.

""The events of last week reinforce the principle that customer experience, security and privacy must be our top priorities,"" Lenovo said in its statement Friday. With this in mind, we will significantly reduce preloaded applications. Our goal is clear: to become the leader in providing cleaner, safer PCs.""

Whether that's enough to regain consumer trust is another issue, and one that every company suffering a supply chain screwup must overcome. ""For all these vulnerabilities we're seeing, somewhere in the pipeline the trust got broken,"" said Robert Olson, a professor at the State University of New York at Fredonia who specializes in information security and ethics.

Smaller companies, especially new startups, may not have the resources or the corporate culture to ensure that they're properly checking how their partners have built their software. ""Superfish's policies may not be your policies,"" said Justin Troutman, a security and privacy researcher and book author. ""If you don't look into the code, you're blindly accepting risks.""

In theory, trust is also an issue between software makers. The burden of proving a program is safe must be borne by each subsequent vendor: Alex must convince Brenda who must convince Christy that their software is safe. ""It's a social negotiation, not a technical issue,"" Lin said. But, he added, the cost of making sure there aren't security flaws in software makes the program significantly more expensive to produce. ""The cost per line of avionics software [for controlling aircraft], stuff that really has to work right, is 10 to 100 times more than ordinary code,"" he said.

What's the solution? Not necessarily regulation

Whatever the process at Lenovo was that broke down or didn't exist and let Superfish through, there's no doubt the goal of the software was to infiltrate a user's Web traffic and change what that person sees. That's a problem for Dan Kaminsky, the security researcher who discovered malicious software from Sony BMG infected more than half a million computers in 2005. ""Imagine a supermarket inserting their own sweetener into Diet Coke,"" he said. ""That's not normal. That's weird, the kind of thing you should be sued for.""

More regulation would seem to be the obvious answer to solving the problem, and it's not unheard of in the security software world. The PCI Security Council, a standards body for governing how software handles financial data, has a certification process to make sure credit card numbers and transactions are handled with the proper precautions, said Avivah Litan, a security analyst with Gartner. ""They look at the code, the quality assurance it goes through, who's managing the [security] keys. It's probably a good idea to extend it to other tech sectors,"" she said, but noted there are risks associated with doing so.

""In financial services, there have been so many breaches caused by third parties that regulators have put rules in, but it's really slowed down innovation and procurement,"" Litan said.

Even if broad regulations demanding higher standards for software security are devised, they may not be effective, for two reasons: many free-to-use, open-source components offer a lot of features to developers at no cost, and software security rarely works with a one-size-fits-all approach. ""It's difficult to define what 'secure' means broadly across all software,"" said Jason Schmitt, who runs Hewlett-Packard's Fortify division, which focuses on software security. ""What you have to define is the process of making it secure.""

Bloatware is here to stay

Preloaded software isn't going to go away, no matter how loudly consumers and security experts howl. In addition to padding their bottom lines by bundling Windows with third-party software such as Adobe Reader, McAfee's antivirus software and the Bing Toolbar, manufacturers are convinced the software benefits consumers. Lenovo's Hortensius pointed to a system update tool his company adds to each new machine that updates drivers, small pieces of software that tell hardware components like printers how to interact with the computer. ""We try to improve the user experience with every piece of software we load,"" Hortensius said.

Sometimes, supply chain mistakes can cost an executive his or her job. Andrew Lack, the Sony BMG CEO at the time of the company's malware-on-disc problem, lost his job over the incident. Lenovo hasn't signaled yet if there will be an executive shuffle for the Superfish incident, but there's already been one lawsuit filed by a Lenovo laptop owner.

""This signals to participants in the supply chain that if they intentionally put in software that makes machines vulnerable, they're going to be taken to task for it,"" Kaminsky said.",html

A major supplier in Southeast Asia is claiming that it will not begin production on components for Apple's iPhone 5 until sometime in September, adding fuel to rumors that say a traditional summer iPhone release will not be happening this year.

A post from AppleInsider references a note to investors from Avian Securities that ""revealed the alleged plans for a September production start. The report said the latest information is 'consistent' with other findings the organization has heard in recent months.""

Another rumor concerning the iPhone 5 is that Apple has been taking its time finding suppliers for the many components that are used to make the iPhone. Whether the recent disasters in Japan have anything to do with the delay is unknown.

Although Apple is typically tight-lipped about its production process and schedules, it seems as though this year's iPhone production has been particularly secretive.

""In addition, Avian also claimed in its note that it has heard that Apple has a lower-priced iPhone

Apple seems to be focused on bringing Mac OS X 10.7 Lion to market this summer, which will bring the Mac desktop OS closer to the wildly popular iOS platform.

Enter Turntable.fm, one of the freshest streaming-music apps to hit the Web scene. Turntable.fm is part music-streaming service, part chat room, and part election. Turntable.fm is similar to other music-streaming Web apps like Pandora and GrooveShark; users can create their own custom playlists and listen to music of similar genres and interests. Now imagine taking that playlist you worked so hard on and sharing it with an audience. Live.

Users create a DJ avatar and enter one of many rooms where they can interact with people of similar musical taste. Five DJ slots are open for people to take their stab at sharing a song from their playlist. Unlike other streaming music apps on the Web, users in Turntable.fm all listen to the same track at once, allowing them to comment or ""politely"" express their disapproval all in real time. Users can also actively vote if the song is ""Awesome"" or ""Lame."" DJs earn points for every vote, which in turn can be used to upgrade their avatars with newer costumes. If enough people vote positively, the onstage DJ racks up points, and users will be treated to a full house of head-banging avatars; enough ""Lame"" votes will force the current track to be skipped.

(Credit: CNET/ Turntable.fm)

While a song is playing, users can hover over the DJ table and choose to either add their song to their Turntable, Last.fm and Spotify (current not available in the U.S.) playlist, or purchase the song from iTunes store. Although it's currently in beta stages, hopefully the catalog support will expand to other music vendors such as Amazon.

As of now, the only way to get an account is to be Facebook friends with someone who already has a Turntable ID. Despite its semiclosed registration, Turntable.fm's membership is growing at a rapid rate. Only a few weeks ago, the number of simultaneous users we'd seen in a chatroom was about 20-30. As of this post, there are rooms that have exploded into over 200 users in one room. Silicon Valley's Coding channel seems to be drawing the biggest crowd.

(Credit: CNET/ Turntable.fm)

Although Turntable.fm can be used as an idle music listening Web app, most of the fun comes from trying to actually score points as a virtual DJ. There's a deep satisfaction that comes from watching your DJ points go up and gaining the approval of your audience, or even blackmailing for points by threatening to Rickroll them. In either case, Turntable.fm's charm comes from being actively involved with your music and the audience, watching the avatars approvingly nod their heads to the beat, and saving up for that insanely expensive Deadmau5 helmet avatar you've always wanted. It's this somewhat simplistic yet addicting system where both users (and investors) will find value in the Turntable.fm experience.

Turntable.fm's combination of Medianet-based search results with user uploaded content already boasts an impressive amount of songs to compile that perfect playlist. One can presume that a good chunk of the profitability will come from users discovering new music through this service, as well as potential advertising opportunities as the site continues to grow.





Currently, Turntable.fm is still in its beta stages, so expect to see some bugs here and there. Log on to see if you're friends with a Turntable member and join the social music experience. Just don't expect to be too productive at work with this running in the background. Sound off in the comments below and let us know how your experience is with it thus far!",html

BARCELONA, Spain--Samsung Electronics admitted that its attempt to breach the tablet market has largely been a flop, with one executive offering a sobering summary of its performance.

""Honestly, we're not doing very well in the tablet market,"" Hankil Yoon, a product strategy executive for Samsung, said today during a media roundtable here.

That's about as frank a statement as it gets from any executive at the Mobile World Congress trade show this week.

That Samsung hasn't met expectations in its tablet business isn't a huge surprise; the company lags well behind Apple's iPad and even Amazon's Kindle Fire in the U.S. market. But for an executive to acknowledge the weakness is refreshing at a time when corporate-speak and jargon dominate conversations--particularly ones of a sensitive nature.

Unlike Apple and other tablet vendors, Samsung has tried a shotgun approach at pushing its Galaxy Tab line of tablets. Initially offering a 7-inch version , it moved up to 10 inches and filled in the rest of the portfolio with sizes in between. Samsung, for the most part, was experimenting with the sizes and using the market as a testbed for what resonates with consumers.

Samsung, however, appears to remain confident that the Galaxy Note will take off. The 5-inch version, which is already out in the market, has been hit by a string of criticism, largely due to its a size. While it acts as a phone, it looks more like a tweener product in between a smartphone and tablet, calling some to label it a ""phablet.""

Yoon said he expects to ship 10 million units of the 5-inch Galaxy Note, lofty expectations for a company still smarting in the tablet business. He believes the S-Pen--the stylus that comes with the device--allows users to more easily create content, rather than consume it.

Samsung earlier this week announced a 10.1-inch version of the Galaxy Note. When asked about the threat of redundant products, Yoon said he hoped the Note cannibalized sales of the original 10.1-inch Tab

""The best thing to survive in the market is to kill your products,"" Yoon said. ""We want to stay competitive in the market.""

That's why Samsung has been focused on pushing the Note and its S-Pen. Having struggled in the traditional tablet market, Samsung wanted to do something different in the category, Yoon said. He added that he no longer carries a physical notepad or papers, and does all of his note-taking on the 5-inch Note.

""Even if the design is similar, how you use the (Note) is totally different,"" he said.

Yoon dismissed the early criticism of the device, saying it would take some education for consumers to get comfortable with the larger size. He noted that three years ago, the largest phone in its line up had a 3.7-inch display, while the Galaxy S II has a 4.3-inch screen. It's just a matter of adapting to a larger screen.

""Once I used this, the Galaxy S II looks too small,"" he said. ""I don't go back to any other smartphone or tablet.""",html

If you're an Outlook user and haven't checked out this service, give it a whirl. It's one of the more interesting Outlook plug-ins.

ToneCheck monitors your e-mail's composing window for potential errors of tone, just as spell-check scans for errors of spelling or grammar. The plug-in will tell you if there are sentences in a message that are likely to come across as aggressive, or likely to cause the recipient to feel sad, or fearful, or humiliated.

If ruining someone's day is what you want, though, ToneCheck won't actually change anything for you. Nor does it attempt to rewrite your messages. It just alerts you to the potentially troublesome emotional backlash you may be setting yourself up for.

The Outlook plug-in is easy to use and unobtrusive. A little meter stays out of the way, only blushing red with a ""Tone Alert"" when your message goes off the rails. When you click through, It tells you how, flagging sentences with words like ""Concerning,"" or ""Upsetting.""

Screenshot by Rafe Needleman/CNET

You get the chance to correct your tone before HR gets wise to you. And make no mistake, the HR department and other corporate overseers are the intended customers for this service. While the individual plug-in is free and kind of sick fun for a while, Lymbix's goal is to sell corporate versions of this app, as well as API access to its service, to businesses and development shops that support them. The idea is to bake this engine into CRM and other outbound messaging systems. The API is also being used, currently, to add outbound sentiment scanning to Twitter via the HootSuite enterprise Twitter management system.

The free app, in addition to being a useful tool for individuals, also serves Lymbix by feeding its database. The ToneCheck service operates in the cloud, and the more e-mail messages the company has, the more tightly it can tune its algorithms. (A surprising tidbit from the company's research: Regional differences account for only about a 5 percent difference in how tone is perceived. I would have thought that you could get away with a lot more hostility if you were a brusque New York business guy than a genteel shop owner in Alabama, but, as you are no doubt about to tell me in comments, stereotypes based on place of business don't make that big a difference.)

Another thing the company does to keep its ToneCheck algorithms always improving: It employs an online panel at its ToneADay site, where users can earn money (not a ton, though) for accurately tagging the emotional content of sentences that they're given. Again, these sentences come from the free ToneCheck users.

Now Playing: Watch this: ToneCheck demo

I found the accuracy of ToneCheck good, but not great. In some test messages, it overflagged sentences as concerning. Others it missed. And there's no way, from the plug-in interface, to tell the system to ignore a given flagged word or exclude a turn of phrase from future scans.

ToneCheck also doesn't scan incoming messages. It doesn't, yet, have the capability of a system like the call routing service Exaudios, which can identify the angriest inbound telephone communication and route it to a company's best fixer. Such a feature may come in the future, CTO Josh Merchant told me.

Also coming this year: A version for Lotus Notes installations. The company is working on a Gmail/Google Apps version as well, but Google apparently doesn't have the necessary APIs just yet. Future feature improvements include even more sensitive filters, for tones like passive-aggressiveness and sarcasm, which, Merchant says, the system doesn't yet scan for. Other tweaks may include an algorithm that's sensitive to your social graph, cutting you emotional leeway with friends and family perhaps.

The new free version of ToneCheck launches this morning.",html
http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-20008749-233.html,"iPhone 4 is out, complaints are in",,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Now Playing: Watch this: Are you killing your iPhone 4 signal?

Though the iPhone 4 is flying off store shelves, the just-released device is already gathering complaints from early buyers.

Apple's latest phone hit stores Thursday to lines of people--some who were waiting 6 hours to buy one. But almost as soon as the device arrived on the doorsteps of customers who placed early preorders came reports of reception problems, discolored spots on the screen, easily scratched exteriors, and issues with third-party accessory connections.

The most prominent complaint on Thursday is customers noticing that touching the seams of the antenna band that runs around the iPhone 4--particularly when holding the iPhone 4 in their bare left hand--interrupts reception, slowly causing the phone to lose its signal.

Some iPhone 4 owners may find they strangle 3G reception after a minute or so if their hands are positioned touching the bottom bar and the side bar of the phone. Others are having trouble re-creating the problem, but it appears to vary by device, person, and location.

Boy Genius Report posted a YouTube videoThursday afternoon that showed the problem might be software-related. The person who posted the video was able to re-create the signal loss while gripping an iPhone 3G upgraded to iOS 4.

CNET Labs continues to look into it.

It's been suggested that using the rubber bumper case that Apple sells separately for $29 is solving the problem because it prevents a user's fingers from coming in contact with the antenna band. It's unclear if this is why Apple for the first time decided to make its own case. The company has previously left that up to third-party manufacturers.

Gizmodo

Apple has not responded to requests for comment.

This isn't the first time reception problems have followed soon after an iPhone's initial release. In 2008 a month after the iPhone 3G debuted, reports that the device would randomly switch between AT&T's 3G and EDGE networks, and that signals bars on the phone would appear to disappear even though reception remained, poured in.

It turned out to have nothing to do with the hardware, but was a software glitch, which Apple fixed with an update about two months later.

But antenna issues weren't the only complaints about the iPhone 4. By Wednesday afternoon Gizmodo and MacRumors had reports from more than 20 people with a brand new iPhone 4 who said there was a yellow discolored area on the screen, or an overall yellow hue to the display even after adjusting the phone's display settings.

The iPhone 4 also scratches easily, according to reports. On Wednesday, Engadget released photos of a five-day-old demo unit with some very discernible scratches on the back side of the iPhone 4. That's despite Apple's claims that the new iPhone has hardened glass on both the front and back because it's better at resisting scratches.

Some Bluetooth accessories made by third-party manufacturers appear to be working inconsistently with the iPhone 4. Certain Bluetooth headsets are pairing as normal with the iPhone, while others seem to require an extra step to get music or podcast playback over Bluetooth.

Apple support forums are also filling with reports from users whose new iPhone 4s are not connecting properly with their car stereo adapters that worked fine for previous model iPhones.

Skyfire for iPhone ($2.99) may be one of the shortest-lived apps in the iPhone App Store, surviving only five hours today before Skyfire pulled it from the marketplace after noticing strain on their servers that resulted in poor user experience.

""The servers haven't crashed,"" a Skyfire spokesperson said, but they did stutter as customers who bought the browser streamed Flash video. The Webkit-based Skyfire app (also available for Android) delivers Flash video to users--ordinarily forbidden by Apple--by streaming it through their own servers first in a process known as proxy browsing.

Skyfire issued a press release earlier tonight declaring that the app has ""sold out,"" and that the company will issue ""a new batch"" of downloads once Skyfire increases its server capacity. In reality, video streaming demand was too much for the Bay Area-based Skyfire's servers, delivering a sub-par video experience to users. Skyfire didn't provide CNET with its first-day download numbers, which Apple should make available tomorrow. In the meantime, Skyfire is ""working around the clock to get the servers back up,"" CNET was told.

This is hardly the first time Skyfire has attempted to dodge slings against its ability to scale the proxy service. Browser-competitor Opera has been calling Skyfire's bandwidth into question since the early days when Skyfire was a green startup for Windows Mobile phones, just enlisted in the browser wars--and Skyfire has predictably averred its readiness since then. We had hoped that years of seasoning had taught the company to prepare their back end for this demand.

Still, it's a sad day when a company survives Apple's app-approval gauntlet just to fall--even if only temporarily--at its own hand.",html

It does two things that make it competitive and unique compared with its competitors that are tied to your desktop: it prioritizes threats based on type, and it attempts to lighten the load that security programs place on your system resources by moving definition files to a community-based cloud.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

The big concern about a cloud-based antivirus is performance, and Cloud Antivirus handled itself decently enough--although it's not a record-setter. On a ThinkPad T42 with a 1.7 GHz Pentium M chip, 1.5 GB RAM, and running Windows XP SP2, Cloud Antivirus used about 23 MB of RAM when idle.

When running a scan, the scan client ate around 40 MB, but the main client jumped to around 32 MB. The scan also took a long time, with only 45 percent of the computer scanned in more than 30 minutes. Pausing the scan client dropped the usage rate from 40 MB to 2 MB.

If you install the program, you can find it listed in your task manager under PSANHost and PSUNMain. There was no noticeable lag when loading programs such as Firefox or MS Word, no browsing the Web. Granted, these tests are empirical and casual, but they bode well for future use by the average consumer.

In February of this year, Panda received higher scores than before for its antivirus detection abilities and lower false positives than in previous years from AV-Test.org.

The program uses a minimalist design to emphasize its features. Cloud Antivirus runs as a panda icon in your system tray. Double-click to open the main screen, which sports a dark theme with translucent borders. The entire window goes translucent when you drag it.

Your security status will appear first, with a large icon and font size telling you whether you're in trouble. Somewhat counter-intuitively, the status tab is on the right side of the window. Moving from right to left, the tabs use icons to identify their features. A bar chart represents the Report tab, a magnifying glass for the Scan tab, and a gear wheel for the Settings. A hard-to-see turned-corner arrow lives in the bottom-right corner of the pane. Click it, and it takes you to the ""neutralized"" window--basically, it's the quarantine. The arrow then moves to the lower left corner, which you need to click again to get back to the main tabbed window.

The layout isn't hard to follow, but users will have to do some exploring since there's no mouse-over labels to help here.

The Settings tab hides proxy settings and a toggle for Panda's proprietary Collective Intelligence cloud network. Turn it off, and one of the program's most powerful features goes away. You'll still get cloud-based definition updates, but you won't be contributing to the community that's keeping you safe. The Scan tab has two options: to scan your entire computer, or to scan selected files or folders from your desktop. The Reports tab lets you see the results not only of your last scan, but also of scans from the past 24 hours, previous week, and past month.

Panda Cloud Antivirus looks like a move that could have long-reaching effects for consumer security, showing that just because your protection is based in the clouds doesn't mean your head is lodged in them.

Wired.com reports that Moviepass will soon enable users to use a smartphone to search for a film, check show times, and provide proof of purchase with ticket takers. The service was announced Monday and is set to launch in a test version in the San Francisco Bay area in time for the July 4th weekend.

This would appear to be a convenience play. Pay a monthly fee in advance, and MoviePass will remove much of the ticket-buying hassle. But in tough economic times, convenience takes a backseat to price. And MoviePass's offer looks like it might provide good value to someone like Roger Ebert or some other film critic who watches hundreds of movies a year. For anybody else, watching enough movies to make it worthwhile would be difficult--and then there's the question of whether there are enough quality films available.

Just watching a movie doesn't provide any benefit if it's a stinker.

MoviePass seems to be out of step with recent trends. First, for those people looking for a bargain, Netflix is the hottest Web distributor of video rentals. Pay $8 a month, or $96 a year, and you can stream an unlimited number of the films or TV shows in Netflix's growing library via the Web. When it comes to appealing to niche groups of film buffs who will pay extra for added convenience, then MoviePass must go head to head with premium video on demand, or PVOD.

PVOD is a plan by the Hollywood studios to offer films for home viewing while they're still playing in the theaters. PVOD films will typically be available for the home about two months after they debut in theaters and will cost around $30 per movie. A typical movie plays in theaters for about three months. In April, DirecTV became the first service to offer PVOD.

As has been stated a thousand times over, there's an app for practically any purpose you could dream of. Some in particular suffer from a glut of apps, and shopping is one of those. With such a wide array to choose from, sorting out which ones are truly useful can be a special kind of challenge. This is why we've taken a rather picky stance in our CTIA wanderings, but a neat little app called Aisle411 managed to catch my eye.

Aisle411 is a feature-packed and user-friendly app aimed at helping you navigate large retail locations, such as Home Depot and grocery super stores. The app has many functions, but what stands out are its list and location features. So for example, you can create a list of all the items you need at Home Depot and it will map out exactly where the items are at the particular retail space you intend to visit. (For those who've never been to a Home Depot, I can't begin to describe how useful this is.)

Aisle411

As for the data on where items are located within a particular store, Aisle411 acquires this on the backend from the retailers as well as through users' interactions with the app itself. That is, if you arrive at the spot for ""double-sided tape"" and it now contains something else, you can tap the Edit Location button on the screen.

Of course, this only scratches the surface of the many features offered by the app. You can also use your phone's GPS to find supported stores near you, the built-in mic to speak lists, and the camera to scan barcodes in order to pull up user reviews on specific products. Aisle411 also integrates discounts and coupons for the items on your shopping list. And as with so many apps these days, there's a social element: you can check- in at and earn badges at stores, as well as easily share coupons and discounts via Facebook and Twitter.

Aisle411 comes out next month for iOS, with a mobile Web element for other devices and plans for an Android app in Q1 of 2011. The initial launch will focus on 1,000 retail locations in 17 metro areas, with more to come early next year. Oh, and did I mention it's completely free?",html

Taking its name from Shakespeare's famous line in ""The Merry Wives of Windsor"" -- ""the world's mine oyster"" -- the service targets the insatiable readers among us. Oyster managed to secure up to 100,000 titles and wrangled in publishers like Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Workman, Smashworld, and even one of the ""Big Six"" -- HarperCollins.

The idea is nothing revolutionary from what some libraries are already offering and what Amazon has made available to their Prime Users ($79.99/yr). Amazon Prime members can already borrow digital books on PC and Kindle. The main difference is that on Prime, users may only check out one book a month, but Oyster lets you read as many as you want.

From our first glance, the service seems to offer some premium selections such as ""Life of Pi,"" the works of Michael Crichton, Jack London, and a couple titles from the Tolkien collection. There is even a social aspect with a book recommendation function and the ability to keep tabs on what your friends are reading. Don't worry, there is a privacy feature in case you don't want people to discover your obsession with a certain novel or genre.

The app may or may not be a good buy for the casual reader, depending on their consumption, but for the literary die-hards it is a steal. Rather than otherwise spending $10-20 per title, you can access as many as you want for the entire month for one price. Of course the downside is that you won't actually own the book.

Oyster is only available by special invitation and you can request yours here. Let us know what you think if you're already invited.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20071043-264/spdy-takes-a-step-beyond-googles-walls/,SPDY takes a step beyond Google's walls,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"SPDY, a would-be standard with which Google hopes to speed up the Web, has taken a baby step outside its founding company's walls.

Strangeloop Networks, a Vancouver company that sells technology and services for hosting content on the Web, now includes SPDY in its products, the company announced yesterday.

SPDY is basically a new and improved HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), the standard that Web browsers and Web servers use to communicate. To develop and test such a technology, a company needs to control both ends of a communication channel, and that's just what Google has done. Google's Chrome browser and some Google Web sites have SPDY built in.

According to Google's white paper on SPDY, the protocol can cut load times for the top 25 Web sites by between 28 percent and 43 percent over a 2Mbps DSL line and 44 percent to 55 percent over a 4Mbps cable broadband connection. The variation depends on the number of SPDY features enabled and changes such as whether SSL encryption is used.

For its part, Strangeloop said SPDY cuts page-load times by at least half. With Web developers striving to shave every millisecond off that lag, that's a pretty substantial boast--at least for those on the Web using Chrome.

Google announced SPDY in November 2009. It plans to make the technology open-source software.

People tend to spend more time on faster-loading pages, and less directly, Google gives fast-loading pages an edge when determining what ads to show next to search results.

Among SPDY's standard features: the ability to request multiple Web page elements over a single network connection, to assign priorities to Web page elements to make sure the most important ones arrive first; and to compress ""header"" data that accompanies the actual Web page information and browser-server interactions. There also are optional ones such as server push, in which the server can send information the browser will need before the browser asks for it, and server hints, a gentler suggestion approach to the same idea.

An indirect benefit of SPDY is that it fares better over Internet connections that lose a lot of data packets or that suffer from long round-trip times--the communication wait for a message to go from one machine to the other and back, Google said.

One of the Google programmers working on the technology, Mike Belshe, said in May he's working on finalizing the SPDY specification. The technology would be overseen by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which is in charge of the HTTP standard. The work caught the attention of Roy T. Fielding, an influential computer scientist who helped write HTTP and the Apache Web server software that's very widely used to host Web sites.

Belshe said Strangeloop has been helpful in developing the technology. ""Strangeloop engineers embraced SPDY from the beginning and provided key data and feedback about their experience,"" he said in a statement.",html

Real Networks has unveiled the twelfth iteration of its RealPlayer media playback software.

Dubbed ""RealPlayer SP,"" the new RealPlayer includes version 11's capability to grab Flash-based videos from any Web browser (albeit with the usual caveat: the streams can't be copy-protected, which rules out most Hollywood movies and TV shows on sites such as Hulu). The ""SP"" designation in the name stands for ""social and portable."" The big upgrade is the capability to easily transcode and transfer those videos to a wide array of portable devices, including many BlackBerry phones, the Zune, and--via iTunes--the iPod and iPhone. It also offers the capability to easily share online video links via social networks such as Twitter and Facebook, as well as via e-mail.

We were able to get a brief early look at the SP beta. The software made it easy to download several Flash videos from YouTube. It was also simple to choose the preset for converting and transferring the videos to a format compatible with a Palm Pre that we borrowed from a co-worker. However, once we transferred the files to the Pre, we weren't able to play them back. However, an earlier demo from a Real Networks representative successfully transferred videos to a Pre, a BlackBerry Bold, and--via a transfer to iTunes--the iPod Touch, so we're assuming we encountered an isolated glitch.

Aside from the Pre playback bug, there were other frustrations. Many of the videos we wanted to save--a ""Star Trek"" episode on YouTube, anything on Hulu, and even a CNET TV video--were all copy-protected, and thus not able to be saved. And the process is time-consuming: downloading was pretty fast, as was USB transfer to portable devices--but the transcoding process was rather poky for videos longer than a minute or two in length. (To be fair, though, slow transcoding time is pretty much endemic to file conversion software.)

The RealPlayer SP beta is available now at Download.com. The Basic version of the software will be free, while the premium Plus version--which offers H.264 video conversion, DVD playback, and DVD burning--will cost $40. It will compete with rival offerings such as Nero Move It, Format Factory, and DoubleTwist (some of which also offer social media hooks). Since the basic version is free, it's at least worth a download to try it out if you have a desire to take your Web videos on the road (so long as they're not copy-protected).

iPads: iPad Air 2, iPad Mini 3

The iPad Air 2 is 18 percent thinner, only 6.1mm. As rumored, it gains Touch ID but not NFC. It has a gapless new Retina display with an anti-reflective coating and incorporates a new faster A8X chip (3x the transistors as A8). There's also a new M8 motion coprocessor, faster Wi-Fi and up to 20 LTE bands. The new camera has 8MP resolution, 1.12 micron pixels, f2.4 aperture and 1080p video. It now supports burst shooting, time lapse and slo-mo. FaceTime camera has better face detection, burst selfies, HDR (since shot) and 1080p video. Plus, a new gold version.

There wasn't much updated in the iPad MIni 3, just the addition of Touch ID and a new gold version.

Both will ship starting next week, with preorders starting now.

Macs: iMac goes Retina, plus Mac Mini updates

For iMacs, the big news is the incorporation of Retina displays into these all-in-one veterans. Given how popular they've become for image and video editing, this is really welcome news. More pixels: it's got a resolution of 5,120x2,880, and Apple's dubbing it Retina 5K. It uses an AMD Radon R9 to drive that. There's also Thunderbolt 2. Prices will start at $2,500, and you can get it now.

There's also a new, Mac Mini with faster everything: two Thunderbolt 2 ports, Intel Iris and HD Graphics 5000 and fourth-gen Intel Core processors. Prices start at $500. It's also available now.

iOS 8.1

After less than a month, 48 percent of users have updated to iOS 8. This update addresses the top sources of customer feedback, including the return of Camera Roll (yay!), In addition, iCloud Photo Library -- shared photos and videos across devices -- is enabled with the update, as is Apple Pay on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It will be available Monday, October 20.

OS X 10.10 Yosemite

Although Apple announced the new operating system at its Worldwide Developer's Conference in June, that was for seeding to developers. Here we learned when it will be available for the rest of us: Today. So is iWork, and both it and Yosemite are free. AirDrop file sharing and Handoff will be enabled when it ships as well.

The organization is set to deliver Firefox 4 in coming weeks. And according to a draft Firefox roadmap, Mike Beltzner, Mozilla's director of Firefox, proposed releasing versions 5, 6, and 7 in 2011, too. This fast-release ethos, pioneered in the browser world by Google's Chrome, means smaller changes arrive more frequently.

For comparison, Firefox 1 arrived in 2004, Firefox 2 in 2006, Firefox 3 in 2008, with Firefox 4 slipping past a hoped-for 2010 ship date and likely to slip past another date set for the end of February.

The faster schedule is designed to make Firefox more competitive by getting new features into users' hands faster. According to Beltzner:

We succeeded in re-energizing the browser market, creating competition and innovation which benefits Web application developers and users alike. This newly competitive market has presented challenges for the continued success of Firefox, and in 2011 we must ensure that we can deliver a product that is compelling to users in order to continue to be able to demonstrate our vision for the Web. To do this we must:  provide a browser that is stable and responsive,  build a product for modern desktop and mobile hardware,  provide a simple set of features and experiences to help users get the most out of the Web,  support Web technologies that are desired most by application developers and users,  deliver those technology improvements quickly to our user base.

It's not easy turning the crank faster, though.

""Changing the way we ship products will require the re-evaluation of many assumptions and a large shift in the way we think about the size of a 'major' release,"" Beltzner said. ""The criteria for inclusion should be no regressions [new bugs], well understood effects for users, and completion in time for a planned release vehicle.""

Firefox's share of worldwide browser usage has remained largely flat, with Chrome and Safari steadily picking up usage in recent months. Chrome, which often serves as a vehicle for Google to promote favored new technologies, moved last year from a quarterly release cycle to an even faster one with twice that pace.",html

Twitter is shutting down the TweetDeck apps for Android and iPhone, as well as axing the Adobe AIR desktop version, the company announced today through the TweetDeck blog.

This means TweekDeck is taking the apps out of app stores in May and, shortly afterward, the apps will stop functioning altogether.

""Over the past few years, we've seen a steady trend toward people using TweetDeck on their computers and Twitter on their mobile devices,"" according to the blog post. ""This trend coincides with an increased investment in Twitter for iPhone and Twitter for Android -- adding photo filters and other editing capabilities, revamping user profiles and enhancing search.

Twitter acquired TweetDeck in 2011. The apps let you see your Facebook updates and tweets, but Twitter is terminating support for that function as well. As these TweetDeck apps get closer to their expiration date, users should expect some outages because these versions rely on Twitter's API, which the company is starting to retire this month.

Instead of improving on the TweetDeck apps in the past 18 months, TweetDeck said it has been focused on building applications for Web browsers and a Chrome app. The operation has doubled its team over the past six months to allow for weekly updates to its Web apps.",html
https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-fixes-big-ie-bug-on-windows-xp-even/,Microsoft fixes big IE bug -- even on Windows XP,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET





Microsoft has issued a fix for a dangerous Internet Explorer bug that left the browser highly vulnerable across every major version -- including those that run on Windows XP.

The patch, delivered at 10 a.m. Thursday, comes out of Microsoft's usual Patch Tuesday cycle because of its severity. It affected IE 6 through 11 and allowed attackers to install malware on your computer without your permission that could be used to steal personal data, track online behavior, or gain control of the computer.

Security firm FireEye, which discovered the previously unknown and unfixed flaw five days ago, said it saw a vulnerability used to target financial and defense institutions on Internet Explorer 9, 10, and 11. Nevertheless, Microsoft's patch today fixes all affected versions of the browser.

""The majority of customers have automatic updates enabled and will not need to take any action because protections will be downloaded and installed automatically,"" Dustin Childs of Microsoft Trustworthy Computing, the company's security group, said in a blog post. ""If you're unsure if you have automatic updates, or you haven't enabled Automatic Update, now is the time.""

Of the decision to fix Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8, the only versions of the browser that still run on the 12-year-old Windows XP, Childs was terse.

""We have made the decision to issue a security update for Windows XP users,"" he said, noting that ""Windows XP is no longer supported by Microsoft"" and that Redmond ""continue[s] to encourage customers to migrate to a modern operating system, such as Windows 7 or 8.1.""

The decision is a notable reversal for Microsoft, which had ended support only weeks ago for Windows XP and the versions of Internet Explorer that run on it. According to research firm NetApplications, Windows XP still accounts for more than 26 percent of the desktops in use.

Childs said that Microsoft encourages Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 customers to update Internet Explorer to version 11, the latest release, if they haven't yet.

Meanwhile, as Microsoft was fixing the bug, FireEye discovered another exploit that used the same vulnerability, but targeted Internet Explorer 8. That means that although there's a patch, the security firm is now seeing ""live attacks"" against Windows XP computers, which except for this patch are no longer being fixed by Microsoft.

Robert Hansen, the vice president of WhiteHat Security's advanced technology group, said that he was surprised at the visceral reaction that the US and UK governments, as well as many individuals, had to the vulnerability.

""The bug itself was really bad, of course, but it was surprising to see such a knee-jerk reaction from the community, telling people to switch from Internet Explorer,"" he said. ""All browsers have had similar issues in the past, and never received that sort of general warning.""

Update at 6:25 p.m. adds details on Windows XP-specific attack and comment from Robert Hansen.

When I hastily grabbed my phone to check a recipe during my first attempt at bibimbap, gunk from my fingers landed on the phone screen, nearly seeping into the speaker and damaging my favorite kitchen companion.

And it really is just that. With fruitful recipe apps like Allrecipes and Epicurious, along with my phone's built-in timer and calculator for measurement conversions, my iPhone and iPad are extremely useful tools, right after a freshly sharpened knife and KitchenAid mixer.

There's just one problem: these gadgets are hanging out in the dangerous war zone that is the kitchen. Chopping, rinsing, and transporting ingredients always involves the inevitable splashing, and your phone or tablet is right there, vulnerable to these kitchen elements and your messy fingertips.

Josh Miller/CNET

Some companies, like Chef Sleeve, offer specialized products to protect your gadgets, but why fork over the cash when there's a perfectly useful product already in your kitchen?

Sandwich bags (and freezer bags for tablets) save your gadget from the messy kitchen, and still let you use your touchscreen's functionality. Even better, place your gadget on a cookbook stand for easier swiping. And when you're done, you can toss the bag or wash and dry it for later use.

If you don't have any plastic storage bags, plastic wrap works, too. Just tightly wrap your phone with a couple layers, then press the plastic wrap together along the edges to seal your phone inside.

Bonus tip: Taylor Martin has a great how-to for mounting a tablet inside your kitchen cabinet for easy recipe-reading.

Dolphin Sonar is a new built-in feature for the Dolphin Browser (download) that lets you control the browser by voice, the company announced yesterday. The feature is a first for mobile browsers.

Currently available only in the Android version of the browser, Sonar can be used to search the Web, open or close tabs, and perform basic page navigation. Dolphin's head of marketing, Edith Yeung, says that the company has been working on it for more than half a year. ""What we want is for people to forget about typing,"" she said in an interview at CNET's San Francisco office last week.

Sonar has been integrated into Dolphin in a way that feels quite natural. You activate it by either shaking the phone with the Dolphin app open, or by holding down on the Gesture button in the lower left corner. Tap the microphone to turn Sonar on, and then speak.

It works by hooking into Google's Voice API, but Yeung said that the server work is their own implementation.

In testing, I found Sonar to be surprisingly flawless. ""Facebook CNET"" instantly loaded the CNET Facebook page; ""Share this"" opened the Share options; ""Google cheese"" brought up search results. A quick flick of my wrist to shake the phone brought up Sonar without fail.

Sonar is basically Siri for the browser, and if it catches on, could positively impact the struggle between apps and browsers. Certainly, other apps that use voice could learn a thing or two from Dolphin.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10265652-2.html,Firefox 3.5 'Web upgrade' planned for end of June,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Mozilla plans to issue a release candidate for Firefox 3.5 on Friday and the final version by the end of the month, Firefox director Mike Beltzner said Tuesday.

The browser, code-named Shiretoko, began its life as a modest 3.1 upgrade. But as Mozilla's ambitions expanded and other browsers such as Google Chrome exerted competitive pressure, the new Firefox was promoted to version 3.5 and its planned ship date slid back several months. You can grab the Firefox 3.5 beta for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Firefox 3.5 comes with a spate of new features--5,000 total, according to Mozilla. Among the major ones: built-in video; local storage to enable richer Web applications that can work even with no network connection; a private browsing mode; geolocation to aid Web pages that can benefit from knowing a user's location; and faster performance loading pages and executing Web-based JavaScript programs.

""We've added technology we think upgrades the Web itself,"" Beltzner said.

Mozilla squeezed in a post-beta-4, pre-RC1 Firefox update last week, and the official release candidate 1 will get mostly a handful of changes to correctly handle some unusual JavaScript situations correctly, Beltzner said. And because of Firefox's extensive beta-testing network--800,000 people use the beta versions--Mozilla expects that RC1 will be the sole release candidate.

""We're aiming the final release around the end of the month,"" Beltzner said.

Net Applications

Update 12 p.m. PDT: Other features in Firefox 3.5 include support for Web workers, which can enable browser-based applications to run in the background; personas to more easily provide themes; downloadable fonts; better built-in graphics technology through CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) standards; the ability to delete browsing traces for a recent period of time or specific Web site; and built-in support for the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) technology for better communications between a browser and server.

What's after Firefox 3.5?

Mozilla has a number of improvements in mind for the successor to Firefox 3.5, code-named Namoroka, and Beltzner said programmers are eager to get 3.5 out so they can get cracking.

One is a process isolation technology called Electrolysis that should help protect Firefox from crashes, said Damon Sicore, director of platform engineering. Competing browsers' process isolation can help keep the browser running even when one page or plug-in misbehaves, but Firefox today crashes in its entirety, employing the less graceful approach of trying to reopen the pages upon restart.

The first phase of Electrolysis will be to isolate plug-ins such as Adobe Systems' Flash so a problem won't crash the whole browser, Sicore said. ""It's going faster than we expected. By the end of July we hope to have a prototype,"" a separate development version of Firefox where the technology can be tested, he said.

Next up for Electrolysis will be a broader isolation technology that separates the processes of tabs, he said. ""The goal for that is somewhere around the end of year in prototype form,"" Sicore said.

Also in the future is a 64-bit version of Firefox for Mac OS X. ""We have people working on that now, a 64-bit version on Mac OS X. The majority of that is supposed to be done by end of quarter,"" Sicore said. Again, loose deadline is for prototype work, not a production version.

Apple's new Snow Leopard operating system is fully 64-bit, including Safari, and Apple boasts that JavaScript runs much faster in the 64-bit version

Most Firefox add-ons should move easily to 64-bit versions, Beltzner said, unless they include binary software compiled specifically for 32-bit operating stems.

Though 64-bit Windows is now arriving, ""It's not one of our supported-tier platforms,"" Beltzner said.

Firefox also plans to improve performance in Namoroka, including start-up time and user interface responsiveness.

Firefox in second place

Firefox broke the lock Microsoft's Internet Explorer had on the browser market, and now there's abundant competition. Apple's new Safari 4 works both on Mac OS X and Windows, Google's Chrome is advancing the performance agenda, and Opera is trying to advance the state of Web computing.

But Mozilla has a big leg up on other IE rivals. Based on the number of machines that ping Mozilla's servers, the organization estimates there are 300 million Firefox users worldwide--a major increase from the 175 million a year ago when Firefox 3.0 was released amid ""Download Day"" promotional fanfare. According to NetApplications, Firefox has 22.5 percent share, a number that Beltzner said corresponds reasonably well with Firefox's own measurements.

""Our growth has been steady and strong throughout the past year,"" Beltzner said.

One of Firefox's competitive advantages is an active community, not just the open-source coders who help Mozilla with the core programming but also vocal fans, translators, testers, and programmers who write add-ons. That community has been helpful in places like Poland, where Firefox has nearly 50 percent market share, and Indonesia, where it has the majority, Beltzner said.",html

Opera 10.5 pre-alpha, for Windows and Mac, is the first browser that's not powered by Webkit to approach JavaScript rendering speeds previously reached only by Chrome and Safari.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

In empirical testing done on an HP desktop running an Intel Core 2 Q6600 at 2.66GHz with 4GB of RAM and Windows 7 32-bit, the pre-alpha scored 435.6 milliseconds in the SunSpider JavaScript benchmark. By contrast, Google Chrome 4.0.266.0, the most recent development build, notched 510.4 ms. The current stable build of Opera was more than 7.5 times slower, at 3284.4 ms.

Opera attributes this dramatic improvement to the new Carakan JavaScript engine, which they have designed from scratch to replace the Futhark engine in the stable build. Opera 10.5 also includes improvements to the Presto layout engine, and a new graphics library called Vega.

Other improvements noticeable in the pre-alpha include changing the URL address bar to include the same style of predictive smart search that Firefox and Chrome have, and the search and address bars now both remember searches, support deleting specific items, and have redesigned layouts.

The main browser interface has been redone, too. The tabs are now on top, the menu bar has been minimized behind a drop-down on the left nav, and the browser has better integration with Windows 7 and Snow Leopard. On Windows 7 there's Aero Peek and Jump List support to access Speed Dial and tabs from the Taskbar. For Macs, there's a unified toolbar, native buttons and scrollbars, multitouch gestures, and Growl support. Dialog boxes are now non-modal, which you means you can now switch tabs without a pop-up commanding your browser's focus, for example. This will affect verification and authentication pop-ups, and JavaScript alerts.

There are some known problems, including a lack of printer support in the Mac version and noticeably high memory usage. Users can expect these to get addressed before the stable build of Opera 10.50 is released. The Opera 10.50 official announcement and changes can be read here, while the current stable version of Opera 10.10 is for Windows, Mac, and Linux.",html

Mozilla is best known as the developer of Firefox, but it's reaching well beyond the browser with a 2012 strategy that strives to use the open Web to counteract ecosystem lock-in.

Firefox embodied Mozilla's effort to counter the damage that Microsoft's browser dominance caused on the Web. But now, as revealed in Mozilla 2012 plans published Sunday, the non-profit organization is putting the crosshairs on other big competitors, too: Apple, Google, and Amazon.

Those companies, along with Microsoft, each are building an ecosystem encompassing devices, operating systems, app stores, and apps. People should be worried about getting locked into any of those ecosystems, Mozilla believes.

Some recent non-Firefox projects at Mozilla have come across as dalliances, but the organization is beginning to sound now like it's found a new cause worth fighting for.

""Mozilla believes that the Web is the platform and the entire Web should be your marketplace,"" one of the 2012 planning documents said.

The 2012 Mozilla road map documents detail plans to improve the Web as a foundation for applications, to create open, decentralized Web-app technology, and to build Mozilla's own app store. That ecosystem-busting work accompanies plans for Firefox's future, efforts to build a browser-based mobile operating system, and better handle identity issues on the Web.

Expanding the mission

Mozilla for years led the charge to modernize Web browsing in a world dominated by Microsoft's Internet Explorer, but in many ways that's last decade's competitive battle. Even as Firefox's user base expanded to the mainstream and made it clear that IE would not rule the world, the old competitive dynamic shattered.

Mozilla

In its place grew a browser dynamic that's more complicated by far: For one thing, Google's brought its power to the desktop browser scene with Chrome. For another, Microsoft came to its senses and embraced the Web standards that Mozilla, Opera, and Apple had previously supported on their own. And a new mobile era began, with Apple's Safari dominating and Google's Android browser growing fast.

In short, the browser market is arguably as competitive as it's ever been--and that means Mozilla needs to look beyond merely being a foil to Internet Explorer. It opened several explorations last year, but now it's picked its priorities.

In short, Mozilla wants to liberate people and programmers from lock-in that's spreading across the Internet landscape. Mozilla is picking its battles, but the organization appears to be bridling at everything from Facebook to Google and Apple app stores.

Here's what Jay Sullivan, Mozilla's vice president of products has to say about the matter:

We've entered a new phase of Internet life. People are experiencing the Internet from a wide variety of mobile devices, using touch, voice and other new interfaces. Their Internet experiences have become inherently social. Along with the development of these new experiences, new Internet ecosystems have developed that are not very much like the Web: ecosystem owners seek to lock in users to vertically integrated stack of hardware, software, identity, and services, rather than enable choice, competition, and innovation at each of these layers. Mozilla can and must continue to empower people with choice and control over their online lives and give developers the power and freedom to innovate and realize their creative potential.

When it comes to ecosystems, Mozilla is working to fight fire with fire by developing its own.

For its programming technology, it's using the Web, and for its underlying operating system to run those programs, it's got Firefox and a new project called Boot to Gecko that aims to build a browser-based operating system for mobile devices.

To that end, Mozilla launched its Web API effort to endow browsers with the ability to control Webcams, monitor battery usage, and dial phone numbers; more recently it joined forces with Opera and others to marry that Web API effort with the World Wide Web's Device API (DAP) project. Mozilla plans to demonstrate BTG in the first quarter.

Mozilla also is working to improve the Web as a programming foundation. That's work that's been going on for years there and at other browser makers, but it takes on new importance in light of Mozilla's effort to form a competing ecosystem and in light of the success of native applications running on iOS and Android.

""We want the platform in Firefox to enable app-quality experiences and developer productivity that rivals native platforms,"" Mozilla said in its Web platform roadmap. That means faster networking, push notifications to get users' attention, better multitouch support, mouse-lock to let people use the mouse as a game controller so they can steer without having to hold the mouse button down constantly, support for the ""flexbox"" interface to adapt layouts to varying screen sizes, and a replacement for the Web intents technology Google proposed as a way to let a Web apps hand off files such as photos to another.

And at a higher level in the ecosystem, Mozilla is building an app store, building off its existing add-ons download site.

""Mozilla is building a marketplace for apps that work across desktops, phones and tablets. Through this marketplace, developers will be able to distribute and monetize their apps,"" Mozilla said. ""Users will be able to get, install and use their apps across all of their devices, regardless of the underlying device/OS platforms. This marketplace will also be the single destination where users can find both cross-platform apps as well as Firefox extensions.""

There are a couple differences between Mozilla's ecosystem and its rivals'. First, it lacks any specific underlying hardware. Firefox is widely used, but not on mobile, and BTG so far remains a project without a real-world way to get it into the people's hands. As Hewlett-Packard has shown, it's hard to break into a mobile market dominated by iOS and Android.

Second, it's an ecosystems designed to avoid lock-in. Mozilla wants Web apps to work on multiple browsers, to be available from other app stores besides its own. To that latter point, it's working on an interface that will mean people only have to buy an app once--not once from each app store.

That's in strongest contrast to Google's Chrome Web Store. Apple's app store for native iOS apps is one thing, but one gets the feeling from Mozilla's that it views a proprietary store for Web apps as a particularly offensive abomination.

The Chrome Web Store is an unsurprising outgrowth of Google's need to distribute Chrome extensions and apps for Chrome OS, Google's browser-based operating system. That can make life easier for developers who only have to test apps against a single browser--but it also undermines the cross-platform nature of the Web.

Firefox future

Firefox remains a core element of the Mozilla strategy. That's sensible, given its continuing if diminished influence, the reality that it's the only reason most people have any idea about Mozilla, and the fact that it drives Google search results that provide the lion's share of Mozilla's tens of millions of dollars of annual revenue.

There's plenty in store for the browser, naturally, according to its Firefox road map.

In the first quarter, Mozilla will mark add-ons as compatible by default with new versions of Firefox so the six-week cycle of rapid-release browser upgrades won't be so plagued with breakage. Add-ons will be synchronized across browsers, too.

In the second quarter will come a proof of concept of Firefox for Metro, the touch-centric interface of Windows 8; integration with Mozilla's Web apps marketplace; silent updates so rapid-release Firefox versions arrive without disruption; a restore option to bring Firefox back to its pristine state; and better start-up speed and scrolling.

In the second half, Mozilla plans to release alpha and beta versions of Firefox for Metro; Firefox Share (formerly F1) to post updates to multiple social networks; a new Australis user interface; the next-generation IonMonkey JavaScript engine; integrated translation services such as those Chrome already possesses; a reader mode similar to Safari's; better performance when lots of tabs are open; and a built-in PDF viewer.

Under the rapid-release program, new features can be built in gradually as they're done.

Overall, Firefox users can expect a firmer foundation for browsing.

""Mozilla understands the value of a responsive user experience and a highly stable and performant platform for Web developers,"" Mozilla said. ""In 2012 strengthened and dedicated teams will wipe out any and all Firefox responsiveness issues users face and guarantee the rock solid stability at low memory costs that developers demand for their apps.""

The ambitions are big even with Firefox, but at least there Mozilla has a strong foothold. The Web-app ecosystem is another kettle of fish, though: for ecosystems to succeed they need developers making software available users buying it.

Mozilla has a leg up in that all browser rivals are pursuing the dream of a powerful Web foundation, but there's a big difference between a Web site reached through an URL and a Web app purchased through a marketplace. But before you declare Mozilla isn't up to the challenge remember that there was a day when Internet Explorer accounted for more than 90 percent of browser usage.",html

Some press surfaced yesterday about how we're bundling advertising offers with an open source software called Nmap. The bundling of this software was a mistake on our part and we apologize to the user and developer communities for the unrest it caused. In addition to immediately taking Nmap out of the download manager, we reviewed all open source files in our catalog to ensure none are being bundled. It is a Download.com policy not to bundle open source software and we will continue to take pains to ensure this does not happen again.

Following on the heels of the Nmap post, there was much speculation about how Download.com protects user security. The security of our users is extremely important to us and we put all files through a rigorous scanning and compliance process before adding them to the Download.com catalog or to the download manager. Some files have been flagged after our initial screening; however, in each case, the flag was proven a false positive. In addition to our scanning, all third-party offers are clearly identified as such, and there is no requirement for the user to download and install the offer; rather, a user has the option to Accept or Decline. Further on the point of user engagement, we are removing the registration requirement to use the Direct Download Link on our site. This allows you, the user, to download the Installer without using the download manager.

Thank you for your patience as we address the issues stated above, and please continue to share feedback on the Download.com user experience.

Sincerely,

Editor's note: We used ScribbleLive to cover Microsoft's presentation today at Mobile World Congress. You can see highlights in the story that follows, or skip down to the embedded ScribbleLive module to replay the event along with commentary from our readers and CNET reporters. You can also click here for a summary post of what was announced.

BARCELONA, Spain--Compromises are out when it comes to computers, Microsoft's Steven Sinofsky said here today as he unveiled the beta for the Windows 8 operating system.

Consumers have been faced with too many decisions, the president of Microsoft's Windows business said during a press event at Mobile World Congress. Functionality vs. battery life? Tablet vs. phone?

Mobile phones, laptops, desktops, tablets are all coming together, he said, though there are still seams.

Aloysius Low/CNET Asia

Microsoft is trying to sew up those seams and offer consumers a ""consistent"" experience, regardless of what type of device they are using. The company is doing so by focusing simultaneously on the operating system, apps, and hardware.

As a result, using Windows 8 should be a ""super fun experience,"" Sinofsky said.

Windows 8 has undergone more than 100,000 code changes since the Developer Preview was released and will feel much more ""refined,"" Sinofsky said. He called Windows 8 a ""generational change"" in its design, function, and implementation.

""The last time we made a generational change was Windows 95,"" Sinofsky said.

Julie Larson-Green, vice president of Windows program management, and Antoine Leblond, vice president of Windows Web services, released details about both the OS and apps.

Larson-Green threw out ""fast,"" ""fluid,"" ""fun,"" and ""functional,"" as the key themes behind the development of Windows 8. She showed off the touch-screen tablet interface, which resembles the tiles on Windows Phone, and a ""charm"" bar that pops up when a finger is slid across the right side of the screen and that takes you back to the home screen.

She used Cut the Rope to demonstrate an Xbox interface designed for both casual and high-end gaming. Larson-Green also previewed an app for ""pinning"" friends and family to the start screen. A revamped messaging service is on tap as well.

Leblond switched the focus from tablets to laptops and noted that Microsoft put as much effort into the mouse and keyboard as it did into the touch screen.

The first big change: the end of ctrl+alt+delete to start up. Now you can just hit enter. Another big change: the start menu has been replaced by a start screen that pops up when the mouse moves over the bottom left corner. Meanwhile, mousing to the bottom right corner zooms out for rearranging tiles and pages, Leblond said. Moving the mouse to the top left corner lets you switch to the previous open app. And the top right corner brings up the ""charm"" menu.

A revamped app store is also part of the changes coming with Windows 8, Leblond said. The store's landing page features a spotlight section that includes top apps, new releases, and recommendations.

All apps are free to download during the Consumer Preview, or beta, he said.

The company announced the eight winners of Microsoft's first app contest. The winners' apps will be shipped with Windows 8. They are Air Soccer, Pew Pew, PuzzleTouch, SigFig Portfolio, Elements Weather, FlipSaw, CookBook, and Physamajig.

Aloysius Low/CNET Asia

Microsoft then switched focus from consumer to enterprise. Michael Angiulo, vice president of corporate planning, brought a device onstage to demonstrate Windows 8 on an ARM processor.

A new generation of mobile PCs will offer a power profile like that of a phone and will be able to stay on standby for a long time, he said. Windows 8 will support four ARM chips: Nvidia's Tegra 3, Qualcomm's Snapdragon, TI's OMAP, and Intel's Cloverfield.

Angiulo showed off Office 15 on a tablet. Full versions of those apps run on ARM, just like on their x86 counterparts. The apps have also been tuned for touch capabilities, but retain mouse and keyboard use. Windows 8 uses less CPU, less power, fewer threads, and less processing, he said. Background tasks are resource managed so they don't block the user experience.

Ultrabooks were up next, with Angiulo demonstrating an 8-second boot on an Intel ultrabook.

Right now, tablets are about touch and PCs are about keyboard. Microsoft is ""changing those assumptions,"" Sinofsky said, onstage with Angiulo.

Touch is an ""and,"" not an ""or,"" Sinofsky said. Users don't have to choose between the two.

Aloysius Low/CNET Asia

Microsoft also demonstrated a monitor/desktop that flips down and goes flat to be used as a gaming station or drafting board.

Finally, the company noted that cloud services can stitch together Windows 8 with Windows Phone and Xbox Live games.

The Consumer Preview is live today on Microsoft's site and is available in five languages. The next milestone is the release candidate, then release to manufacturing, and then general availability. There was no comment on the timing of the releases.

Windows 8 Enterprise will be shown off at CeBIT, which starts March 6 in Hanover, Germany.

An edited transcript of the live blog starts here:

5:47 a.m. PT: Scott Stein: Hi, everyone, welcome to the CNET Microsoft Windows 8 live blog from MWC. I'm Scott Stein, and I'm your humble moderator.

5:59 a.m. PT: Seth Rosenblatt: I think people who've been playing with the Dev Preview will be pleasantly surprised today, but answers to larger questions would surprise me.

6:14 a.m. PT: Seth Rosenblatt: Something to keep in mind is that MS is the only vendor to approach the tablet from the PC side. Google and Apple have come at it from phones.

6:18 a.m. PT: Seth Rosenblatt: Expect MS to make a big push that what they're NOT doing is scaling down the PC. They're going to argue, essentially, that they're upgrading the tablet.

6:23 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Steven Sinofsky takes the stage. ""We started this project as we ended our Windows 7 project."" Sinofsky is the president of Microsoft's Windows business--that's a pretty important part of the company.

6:24 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Sinofsky says we face too many choices where we have to choose between things: consumption or productivity? functionality vs. battery life? tablet vs. phone? Leads into Microsoft's ""no compromise"" message the company hammered during CES.

6:25 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Sinofsky says that all the services and software should go wherever you go on whatever product you are on. Mobile phones, laptops, desktops, tablets are all coming together, he says, but notes there are still seams.

6:26 to 6:28 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Says there is a new level of engagement with partners and ecosystem to develop Windows 8. Promises a huge array of devices, form factors, etc., but with a consistent experience. Sinofsky says there are significant changes since the developer preview software. There is a whole new level of functionality, he says, with over 100,000 code changes to Windows 8. The Consumer preview will represent a whole new product. Much more refined, he says.

6:28 a.m. PT: Seth Rosenblatt: If MS is truly significantly more engaged with hardware partners than ever before, this Windows 8 thing might just fly.

6:29 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Windows 8 is a generational change in how Microsoft designed the product, and the function and implementation. ""The last time we made a generational change was Windows 95."" He says Windows 8 is made to be easy for everyone.

6:31 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: The work we've done to make it easy to use is a ""super fun experience,"" and comes naturally to people, he says. The idea of looking at things with a glance--which it touts for Windows Phone--is coming to Windows 8 too. Sinofsky says it will scale across multiple devices, experiences, and uses. Today, he says you have to use this app or that app. You should be able to get the apps you want, that connects to the service you want. The idea of adding apps.

6:32 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Says Metro style design language ties together everything in Windows 8. Metro designed to scale to different devices.

6:32 a.m. PT: Scott Stein: (The interface keeps reminding me of the Xbox 360. Which makes me wonder if the Xbox 720 will be Windows 8...)

6:32 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Xbox 720 with Windows 8 would be pretty cool, but makes me wonder why I don't just switch to PC gaming.

6:33 to 6:35 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Julie Larson-Green, VP of Windows program management, and Antoine Leblond, VP of Windows Web services, introduced. Microsoft gives the first vendor partner love to Samsung. Julie up first, says she will work with a Samsung Windows 8 device. Larson-Green pulling up the Samsung tablet device. Says it's designed to be personal. Demonstrating the touch password on a photo of her husband and son.

6:36 to 6:37 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Runs through the Start screen, which looks like the Windows Phone OS with live tiles. Fast and fluid were the key themes for the Windows 8 experience. It should be fun and functional, she says. She's using a tablet, so this interface makes sense. I wonder how it will work with a keyboard and mouse?

6:38 to 6:39 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Shows off the HTML 5-based browser and Bing page, which is nicely integrated into the Windows 8 experience. It may make some people think twice about using Firefox or Chrome. Goes through a ""charms"" bar that allows you to go back home. You pull it up by sliding your right thumb from the edge to the screen. That's sort of like the PlayBook or WebOS user interface. Now, she's running through an Xbox interface.

6:39 a.m. PT: Seth Rosenblatt: It is a bit of ""WebOS done right,"" at least when it comes to navigation.

6:40 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Microsoft made it great for both high-end games and casual games alike. Showing off Cut the Rope. It's easy to take an HTML 5 game and turn it into a Windows app--says it took about 5 months.

6:42 to 6:43 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Instead of alt-tab, you can use your left thumb to slide through the various open apps. Or you can slide your thumb a bit to pull up a list of open apps. You can take your finger from the top and drag it down to close the app -- that's really like WebOS and QNX! Talks about pinning people to the start screen for updates on the individuals you care about.

6:43 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: I'm sure that's great for stalkers.

6:44 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Pulls up a revamped messaging service. It looks different and clean. It also uses a bit of the aero snap when juggling multiple apps like IM and video. If you pull it to one side, it'll snap to cover one side of the screen. The snap feature is a great idea, but I NEVER use it on Windows 7.

6:45 a.m. PT: Scott Stein: Agreed.

6:45 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Windows 8 has a systems-wide sharing concept, she says. Apps don't need to know anything about each other for them to work together, she says.

6:46 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Now for Antoine Leblond, who will talk about the laptop experience. Pulling out a Lenovo ultrabook to demonstrate Windows 8. Notes how much attention they paid to touch for the tablet. He says they paid as much attention to the mouse and keyboard.

6:47 to 6:49 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Hey, they removed ctrl-alt-delete to unlock...just hit enter! WHY did it take so long to do that? Leblond using the mouse to scroll through the various screens, says you can roll through mouse to move from side to side. Leblond says a finger is great for pointing and gestures. A mouse is good at precise pointing, but not so great for gestures. Leblond says Windows 8 uses the corner for navigation.

6:49 to 6:51 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Move to the bottom left corner to go back to the start screen. Go down to the bottom right corner to zoom out. Leblond says zoom is great for rearranging tiles and pages. Move the mouse to the top left corner to switch the previous open app. You can cycle through the apps there. The corners make it really easy to move around the UI, he says.

6:52 to 6:53 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: You can also pull up a listen of active apps in a sidebar by moving the mouse to the left. Move your mouse to the top right corner for the ""charms"" menu.

6:53 to 6:55 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Leblond starts up the USA Today app by typing USA, which automatically pulls it up. Demonstrates the ease in which you can take the USA Today article and share it to Wordpress. Notes the apps don't talk to each other, but still works. Leblond says Windows 8 is an even better Windows than Windows 7. Yeah, they sort of have to say that, right?

6:56 to 6:58 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: He's switched back to the traditional Windows view. The traditional desktop look - it's another full-screen metro-style app, he says. The desktop-as-an-app feature is a pretty interesting concept.

6:56 a.m. PT: Seth Rosenblatt: Impressively, it's true this time!

6:59 to 7:01 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Julie back on stage to show off the all-in-one touch-screen-enabled PC. She says it's not one or the other, and that they can work together (touch or mouse/keyboard). She throws out a magical line! Demonstrates Skydrive and Skydrive app, which makes it easy to find her files. She's scrolling through her photos with her fingers, while navigating with the keyboard and mouse, demonstrating the back and forth and flexibility of the system.

6:59 a.m. PT: Seth Rosenblatt: This is going to be the hardest thing for people coming to Windows for the first time, the discordance between Metro and desktop.

7:02 to 7:04 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Now demonstrating email, pulling pics from local drive, and more pics from the Skydrive, into a single message. Nifty. You can also browse and search within an app. Pull up the ""charms"" menu to get search, including Web, video, Xbox Live games, etc. Sort of like the universal search on an iPhone. That means searching for content within apps, including news, maps, etc. Antoine is back out to talk about the app store.

7:04 to 7:05 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: He's running through a tour of the store. He says the store was designed to be easy to look for apps. The landing page of the store starts off with the spotlight section, including top apps, new releases, and recommendation. You can pan through the tiles for categories, similar to Windows Phone. The listing page for the app gives lots of details on the app, from reviews and ratings. It looks very much like any mobile app store. Or even Apple's Mac app store.

7:05 to 7:07 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: During the consumer preview, all of the apps are free, he says. So go crazy downloading apps! Says developers are excited about the process for adding apps to the store. Says they appreciate Microsoft has the best economics of any app store. Also liking the huge reach of Microsoft. Windows 8 will be a great opportunity for small developers, talks about an app content to spur development. The store makes it easy for developers to build and distribute apps, he says.

7:07 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: The free apps element is crazy. Crazy smart.

7:08 to 7:09 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Announcing the first 8 winners of its first app contest. Air Soccer, Pew Pew, PuzzleTouch, SigFig Portfolio, Elements Weather, are among the winners. They all look pretty slick. The other winners include FlipSaw, CookBook, and Physamajig. Check them out. After all, they're free!

7:11 to 7:13 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Hmm ""no compromise"" or ""fast and fluid,"" can't tell which is the bigger buzzword today. Sinofsky is back on stage, by the way. The idea of apps pulling info from each other, and work with Skydrive and the computer itself is really enticing. When you use one app, the other apps get better, Sinofsky says. The Windows store is a marketplace for apps, and is a new opportunity for developers. Touts the fast and modern presentation.

7:13 a.m. PT: Seth Rosenblatt: One of the most interesting parts of Windows 8, and sadly limited to Enterprise at the onset, is going to be a thumb drive with W8 installed. Stick it in, boot up, log into W8 and go. Shut down, take your key and all your data is saved to the cloud.

7:15 to 7:16 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Sinofsky talking about hardware now. Working on differentiation across broad range of hardware. Going to preview some of those devices. Sinofsky will show off SOC (system on a chip) devices--also known as tablets. Designed Windows 8 to meet the needs of a broad range of customers, but especially professionals who live in front of the computer. Wanted to show how enterprise control was part of the build from the beginning.

7:15 to 7:17 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Sinofsky talks about moving from screen to screen. What about a mobile phone screen? Michael Angiulo, VP of corporate planning, is on stage to demo Windows 8 on an ARM processor. We are going to have a new generation of PCs with a power profile like a phone, which can stay on standby for a long time.

7:16 a.m. PT: Seth Rosenblatt: The hardware bit. This'll make Win 8 or break it.

7:17 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Something Intel doesn't do very well.

7:18 to 7:21 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Angiulo having a bit of trouble logging in, but finally unlocks it. Nvidia Tegra 3, Qualcomm Snapdragon, TI OMAP and Intel Cloverfield chips in devices on display. Sinofsky says Windows 8 will support all four chips. Notes the same app is running on an ARM device as well as X86. It's the same code, he says. Notes the same app is running on an ARM device as well as X86. It's the same code, he says.

7:19 a.m. PT: Seth Rosenblatt: I have a hard time understanding the point of W8 on ARM. Isn't W8's best feature that it's NOT stripped down? Aren't the ARM processors the dreaded ""C"" word? (Compromise)

7:23 to 7:24 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Windows 8 uses less CPU, less power, fewer threads, processing, he says. Background tasks are resource managed so they don't block the user experience. Says partners will get testing devices for apps and hardware testing. A shout out to AT&T for its LTE network, which will help with the development process. Now on to ultrabooks.

7:25 to 7:25 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Angiulo starts with an Acer and shuts it down for a cold start. Claims the boot will take only 8 seconds. Fast boots will be the normal for ultrabooks...although that's supposed to happen on Windows 7 too.

7:26 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Shows off an Acer laptop with a motorized door that slides out and exposes ports. Not sure how practical that is.

7:26 a.m. PT: Scott Stein: Yowza. 8 seconds is...killer on a laptop.

7:28 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Talking about the Samsung Series 9, another thin laptop. Looks at the task manager, which shows how the software parks an app that isn't being used, which enhances battery life. You don't have to close apps because they are put in a state of sleep, and resume quickly when you go to it.

7:28 a.m. PT: Scott Stein: That's the Acer Aspire S5. Saw it at CES. That motorized door is Trouble.

7:29 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Yeah, I can see that breaking quickly.

7:30 to 7:31 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Says they've done work to make networking easier on these devices. You can manage your various radios, whether it's Wi-Fi, or even cellular. There's an airplane mode too.

7:32 to 7:33 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga, another next-gen ultrabook with a touch screen. It can fold itself back around to be used like a tablet. We're in a world where tablets are about touch, and PCs are about keyboard. We're changing those assumptions, Sinofsky says.

7:33 a.m. PT: Scott Stein: The Yoga's sleekly designed, and could be the best current example of that tablet/laptop design working w/ Windows 8

7:33 to 7:34 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Says form factors will start adapting to increased use of touch controls. Demonstrates a monitor/desktop that flips down and goes flat, to be used as a gaming station or drafting board. That is really cool.

7:33 a.m. PT: Seth Rosenblatt: I'm wondering if a IdeaPad Yoga flip-hinge is going to be the new thin

7:34 a.m. PT: Scott Stein: We've seen these tablet/laptops before, but Win 8 and capacitive touch displays could re-invent the concept.

7:35 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Sinofsky says the mouse is 30 years old, and notes that when they were introduced, they were controversial. Sinofsky says to keep an open mind and not be locked into the old way of interacting with a computer. Bring the PC to you, he says. Says the combination of touch and mouse/keyboard will become natural after use.

7:36 to 7:38 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: They go to the big HD screen, which is an active touch-screen device! I'd want one in my apartment, please. Says it can support 100 fingers, so 10 people can use it at the same time. It's an 82-inch display. That's crazy big!! Says it feels natural because it sticks to your finger. Demonstrates a dual-core AMD system in a little box, which can be mounted to a display. Says the AMD box was held up at customs because they couldn't believe it was a computer.

7:38 to 7:40 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Now a demo of Windows 8 on multiple monitors. That's right up my alley! Engineered an improved toolbar that spans the multiple monitors. An NFC shout out! A demo of connecting a Bluetooth speaker to a computer via an NFC tap. That could be a Nokia thing, as Nokia has been big on offering NFC-enabled accessories like headsets and speakers. So look forward to NFC capabilities on Windows Phone...when Microsoft supports the tech.

7:38 a.m. PT: Seth Rosenblatt: The multi-mon feature in W8 is very cool. You guys are gonna dig this.

7:41 to 7:44 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Windows will treat all drives as one extended drive. Different speed or size drives will all act under one pool of hard drive space. Showing off a video player app, that can stabilize a video in real time. It's an example of the power of the PC. Surprise! That computer wasn't running Windows 8. It's actually a Windows 7 PC running Windows 8 via a UBS drive. That would be the Windows to Go feature, which is pretty sweet. Windows to Go is a cool enterprise capability, Sinofsky says. But he says Microsoft will talk more about the enterprise capabilities at CeBit. Whoopie, another trade show...

7:45 to 7:48 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: Touch PCs are on the way in all shapes and sizes, Sinofsky says. Sinofsky says touch is an ""and,"" and not an ""or."" You don't have to choose between the two. ""You choose the form factor, and Windows 8 will follow you,"" he says. Talks about how cloud services can stitch together Windows 8 with Windows Phone and Xbox Live games.

7:46 a.m. PT: Seth Rosenblatt: Windows to Go is the USB key-hosted W8 I was talking about earlier. Could be killer if they figure out a way to get it to the average consumer.

7:49 to 7:51 a.m. PT: Roger Cheng: General availability update: Windows 8 Consumer Preview today in five languages. You'll see updates to the OS, new drivers from partners, updated preview apps. it'll be a dynamic consumer preview. Windows 8 Enterprise will be shown off at CeBIT. Says the next milestone is the release candidate, and then RTM, then general availability. No comment on timing of the release. Windows 8 caused a network hiccup, he says. Notes downloads have occurred in 70 countries. Okay, Sinofsky has wrapped up. That means we're wrapped up too. Thanks again to everyone who tuned in for our live updates.

7:52 a.m. PT: Seth Rosenblatt: MS is currently sticking to a release schedule very similar to Windows 7. No official announcement, but don't be surprised to see an RC around June, RTM around the end of July, and on new hardware in October.

The original story is below.

BARCELONA, Spain--Microsoft may be dumping the Consumer Electronics Show, but it still has a lot of love for Mobile World Congress.

The software giant's massive presence at the world's largest mobile trade show here highlights the shifting priorities of technology companies. Microsoft could have used its final keynote address at CES last month to make a big splash with Windows 8, but instead opted to use a more mobile-focused venue.

The company has a lengthy and comprehensive press conference planned for Wednesday as it runs through the details of its Windows 8 operating system.

Windows 8 takes Microsoft one step closer to the ultimate integration of the PC, tablet, and smartphone experience--something that rival Apple is also racing to get to with its iOS and OS X platforms. Microsoft's Metro-style tiles, for instance, create a consistent experience between Windows 8 and Windows Phone.

Microsoft hasn't been silent or slumbering leading up to its big press conference. The company has already lowered the spec bar on its Windows Phone platform. This allows vendors to make more affordable phones, as illustrated by Nokia's newly unveiled Lumia 610 .

We'll be covering Microsoft's presentation with ScribbleLive, so come back here around 5:45 a.m. PT Wednesday. We'll start the live-blog at that point--about 15 minutes before the event itself--and then give you the blow by blow.

Baidu has offered up a beta version of its first-ever browser, and at first glance, it looks quite similar to Google's Chrome.

The browser, which was made available for download earlier this week on Baidu's site, includes a single bar at the top, allowing users to either input addresses or search the Web. In addition, the browser's home page offers access to an application marketplace, similar to the Chrome Web Store, featuring thousands of programs users can access. When users choose an application, including the Youku video service or Sina's Weibo microblog offering, it's added to the home page.

According to The Wall Street Journal, opened applications appear in a new tab, and many of them are hosted by Baidu.

With the launch of a browser, Baidu now puts itself squarely in competition with Microsoft's Internet Explorer, the most-used browser in China. According to data from China-based researcher CNZZ, Microsoft's market share in June stood at nearly 63 percent, easily overshadowing Chrome's 2.52 percent share and Firefox's 2.06 percent slice of the market.

Although it might have a long way to go to catch Microsoft, Baidu is an online force in China. The company owns nearly 76 percent of the Chinese search market, according to China's Analysys research firm. That alone could help the search giant push its browser to more users and become a major player in that market.

Although Baidu has its sights set on Internet Explorer, the company has actually formed a close bond with Microsoft. Earlier this month, the companies announced that Microsoft would supply results to all English-language search queries through Baidu.

Baidu's new browser is available now as a free download to XP, Vista, and Windows 7 users only. The company has yet to reveal whether it will launch Mac or Linux versions in the future.",html
http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-31747_7-20042222-243.html,CNET's ongoing iPad 2 review,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"James Martin/CNET

On the day the Apple iPad 2 goes on sale, CNET Senior Editor Donald Bell will be live-blogging his full review. Follow along for his complete analysis of the design, features, and performance. Updates will be added throughout the day.

The competition must really hate Apple. The Apple iPad wasn't just a successful tablet computer in 2010--it was the tablet computer. In one fell swoop, Apple created the new tablet market and sold tens of millions of iPads in spite of a global economic downturn and considerable skepticism.



The same, only better

With the iPad's second go-around, Apple sticks to its successful formula. The iPad 2 is thinner, faster, and includes two cameras. Otherwise, the iPad stays the same: size, price, capacity, and features all carry over.

Oh, except for color. Apple now offers both white and black versions of the iPad 2 in every price and configuration. The base model starts at $499, giving you 16GB of storage and a Wi-Fi connection to the Internet. If you want more storage for all your apps, photos, music, and videos, you can jump up to the 32GB ($599) or 64GB ($699) models.

The freedom to surf the Web over a 3G cellular connection costs an extra $130 over any of the three capacities mentioned above, plus monthly carrier fees. Unlike for the original iPad, you now have a choice of two carriers (Verizon and AT&T). Choose carefully, though, since the Verizon version of the iPad can't be made to work on AT&T, and vice versa.

The hardware

The iPad 2 is thin--so thin, in fact, that it feels like a different device. Measuring just 0.34 inch, it's thinner than the iPhone 4 and a third thinner than the original iPad.

Despite the thinner design, its construction quality is no less rugged than the original's. The back of the iPad is still made from a durable, single slab of aluminum machined to fit the iPad's internal components like a glove. The face of the iPad is covered in the same scratch-resistant glass, with a home button at the bottom of the screen and a new front-facing camera at the top.

Otherwise, the iPad 2 sticks to familiar iPad routines. The iPad's sleep/wake buttons and headphone jack are right up top, just as on the original, as are the volume rocker and mute/rotation lock switch on the right edge. On the bottom you'll find the iPad's universal dock connection and the internal speaker. The speaker's perforated grille now wraps around the back, giving it more surface area and noticeably better sound quality.

For the iPad 2, Apple has avoided compatibility shenanigans. With the exception of any original iPad cases, the device works with first-gen accessories (docks, adapters, speakers, video cables, chargers), though first-gen docks don't fit like a glove. An updated standard dock for the iPad 2 is available. For keyboard support, Apple now recommends its Bluetooth wireless keyboard.

The iPad 2 accessory that's really getting all the attention is Apple's new Smart Cover. An answer to all the bulky, overdone third-party cases made for the first iPad, Apple's unique hinged cover comes in two types--leather ($59) and polyurethane ($39)--and multiple colors. It attaches magnetically to the left or right edge of the iPad 2 using two aluminum hinges embedded with impressively strong rare-earth magnets. Magnets within the cover are also used to detect when the cover is open or shut, which allows the iPad 2 to automatically wake or sleep. It works, but you also have the option in Settings to bypass the automatic wake feature and use the button manually.

As accessories go, the Smart Cover is nifty--not so much for the protection it offers, but for the convenient stand it provides when rolled up. If, on the other hand, you are seriously concerned about protecting your investment, keeping the iPad 2 in a traditional wraparound case is still the best way to go.

(Update, 1:50 p.m. PT) Features: New stuff

The iPad 2 isn't a radical departure from the original, but it does have a few new tricks up its sleeve.

The banner feature for the iPad 2 is the addition of two cameras, both able to record video or snap photos. The camera on the back is located in the upper-right corner where it isn't likely to be covered by your hand (in portrait orientation, at least). It looks just like the chrome-ringed lens on the iPhone 4 and is similarly blessed with 720p video capture. There's no camera flash, however, and the camera sensor is a far cry from the one used on the iPhone 4. Just like the fourth-generation iPod Touch, the iPad 2 takes what are essentially video stills.

Even if Apple had gone the route of using a Zeiss lens and a 10-megapixel sensor, the iPad 2 just isn't a replacement for a camera or smartphone. Having tested camera quality on tablets over the past year, we can't stress enough how silly you feel shooting videos or photos with a tablet in public. It's like taking a picture with a cutting board. Your grandfather's camera was less conspicuous. You get looks, and they're not the envious kind.

Really, the cameras are there as a way to support Apple's FaceTime video chat application, which is now available for Mac, iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad 2. If you've been waiting for the Jetsons' video phone, FaceTime on the iPad gets you pretty close. Unlike smaller devices, the iPad's 9.7-inch screen can present faces at life size. We've seen this before with desktop- and laptop-based video calling, but it can be uncanny to actually hold someone's life-size face in your hands. FaceTime still remains a Wi-Fi-only feature, however, so in-car iPad video calls are an elusive capability (probably to humanity's advantage).

Other iPad 2 apps designed by Apple include GarageBand and iMovie, which must be purchased separately for $4.99 each. The iPad is the last of Apple's iOS devices to be blessed with iMovie (and the camera required for it), but is the first to receive GarageBand. We have separate write-ups of both GarageBand for iPad and iMovie for iPad available for more depth.

Under the hood, the iPad 2 has plenty to brag about. The new spec uses a dual-core A5 processor that promises to be twice as fast with nine times the graphics performance.

Another feature sure to burn the competition is full HDMI audiovisual output compatibility. Using a $39 dock cable, the iPad can now mirror its output to a TV over a standard HDMI connection. The supported resolution goes up to 1080p, though video playback and most apps never break out of 720p. Unlike previous video-out solutions for the iPad, this cable no longer limits you to video playback or presentations only. Everything you see on the screen can be mirrored on your TV, including video, photos, games, and the home screen. Competitors such as RIM's PlayBook and the Motorola Xoom have been pointing to HDMI compatibility as a key advantage over the iPad. Now they have one fewer bragging point.

The iPad 2 also adds the same three-axis gyroscope sensor shared by the iPhone 4 and iPod Touch, giving the device a more detailed sense of its orientation in space, similar to the feeling of holding a Nintendo Wii remote. The gyro's appeal is mostly for gaming, allowing for more precise motion control and realistic navigation within virtual environments. In a first-person shooter game like N.O.V.A., for instance, you can tilt the iPad 2's screen up, down, left, or right to explore the game's surroundings, just like a window into the game's universe.

(Update, 2:15 p.m. PT) Features: Oldies but goodies

Cameras and gyros are nice, but let's not forget all the features that made the original iPad unbeatable. If you've ever used an iPhone or iPod Touch, the iPad 2 will feel immediately familiar. Out of the box, you get many of the iPhone's capabilities, including Apple-designed applications (apps) for Web browsing, e-mail, maps, photos, music, video, YouTube, and more. More apps can be installed using the built-in App Store software or by connecting the iPad to iTunes via your computer using the included cable. If you already own apps purchased for an iPhone or iPod Touch, you can transfer these apps to the iPad, as well.

The original iPad made its debut with iOS 3.2. That operating system's limitations seem prehistoric today. You couldn't bounce between applications with multitasking. You couldn't organize applications into folders. And support for document printing and AirPlay streaming of music, videos, and photos didn't arrive until November of 2010.

At launch, the iPad 2 comes with iOS 4.3, bringing a host of important new features and improvements. There are new apps for PhotoBooth (a dedicated portrait-taking app), and FaceTime video chat. The Safari Web browser gets a speed boost under the hood for improved JavaScript rendering. The iPod app now includes a Home Sharing option for streaming media over your home network from local computers. And for those of you who want flexible control over the function of the switch above the iPad's volume buttons, iOS 4.3 hands over the reigns and allows you to designate it as either a rotation lock or a mute button for system alert sounds (such as incoming FaceTime calls).

One sticking point that Apple hasn't addressed from the original iPad is Adobe Flash support for its Safari Web browser. Apple seems dead-set against supporting Adobe's popular tool for presenting video and graphics on the Web, and without it, many corners of the Internet are inaccessible on the iPad or present a Swiss cheese of broken content. For the most part, though, the iPad's Web browsing experience is the best you'll find on a tablet. Navigation is responsive, zooming in and out of text is fluid, and managing multiple open pages is a cinch.

The iPad's device features, such as Bluetooth 2.1 (A2DP, EDR), Wi-Fi 802.11 n, 3G, and 10 hours of battery life, are all here, and in many cases are still the bar by which other tablets are judged.

Wi-Fi versus 3G?

For road warriors or those who just get a little itchy at the idea of not being connected to the Internet, Apple offers a version of the iPad with an integrated 3G cellular data connection.

Aside from a negligible added heft of 0.1 pound and the fact that buyers are paying an extra $130 for the 3G capability (compared with Wi-Fi-only models), there's no downside to owning a 3G-compatible model. Unlike the data plans for most smartphones, the iPad doesn't come with any long-term contractual obligations. If you don't end up using the iPad's 3G capability, you can cancel the data plan at any time.

If you decide to go with the 3G option for the iPad 2, you have your choice of two carriers: AT&T or Verizon. Data plans and fees differ between the two carriers (and are always subject to change), and the 3G cellular technologies under the hood differ as well.

The AT&T iPad model uses a GSM modem and a MicroSIM card slot, allowing you to easily swap in compatible MicroSIM cards from foreign carriers when overseas. Verizon's iPad uses a CDMA 3G modem and lacks the SIM-swapping feature of AT&T's GSM modem, making it a poor choice for international jet-setters.

As far as data plans go, AT&T offers two options: $15 a month for 250MB of data, or $25 a month for 2GB. Each option can be prepaid for a month in advance and AT&T's plans do not include an activation fee.

Verizon's plans are a little steeper, but more generous with data. There's a 1GB plan for $20, 3GB for $35, 5GB for $50, and a whopping 10GB for $80. There's an initial $35 activation fee, however, which you run the chance of paying each time you let your account lapse for longer than three months.

To our eyes, AT&T's plans seem more consumer-friendly and its GSM technology more flexible for travelers. That said, the plans from both carriers seem reasonable and data quality and coverage should be your first concern. Before making the plunge, do some research to see which carrier provides the better coverage in your area, as well as in the places you frequently travel.

Another advantage to iPad 2 models enabled with 3G is the added capability of assisted-GPS, allowing you to accurately pinpoint your location on a map and take advantage of navigation and location-aware apps. The Wi-Fi-only models of the iPad can use rudimentary Wi-Fi hot-spot triangulation techniques to guess locations, but are much less accurate and consistent.

If you have no plans to regularly use the iPad outside of your home, you'd do just as well to save some money and stick with a Wi-Fi model.

(Update, 3:30 p.m. PT) iPad 2 as e-reader

When Apple pitched the original iPad and then-new iBooks app as the quintessential e-book reader, we were skeptical. Apple had only a handful of publishers, and the device was as thick as two Kindles put together. We were skeptical.

A year later, the iPad has legitimately seized the attention of the publishing industry. Apple claims to have passed its 100 millionth iBook download. Meanwhile, competitors such as Barnes & Noble, Amazon, and Kobo, have all jumped on board with apps for the iPad. Mainstream magazines, including The New Yorker, Wired, Vanity Fair, and others, all have iPad-specific editions. Even specialty publications, such as comic books, test prep, and sheet music have found their way onto the iPad. As far as content goes, the iPad has you covered.

In terms of hardware, the iPad is still a little beefy at 1.3 lbs, compared to the Kindle 3's 0.55 lbs. And in spite of the iPad's otherwise excellent IPS LED-backlit display, there's no beating e-ink displays when it comes to outdoor readability. Also, a product like the Kindle DX promises up to four days of reading without a recharge, whereas the iPad will only get you 10 hours.

Despite the criticism, the iPad has already proven itself a success as an e-reader. There are certainly cheaper options out there, but none with the breadth of features offered by the iPad. Plus, with the iPad 2's dramatically thinner design, Apple is in much better shape than it was last year.

What the iPad still isn't

We have plenty of kind things to say about the iPad, but there is a limit to its ""magic."" Tablets, in general, sit between the practicality of laptops and the convenience of smartphones, but stop short of actually replacing either device.

The iPad 2 is not a laptop replacement. After spending a year with the original iPad, we've come to appreciate laptops more than ever. In most cases, laptops and netbooks offer a more natural typing experience, and there's still nothing like a tried-and-true mouse or trackpad when it comes to editing and navigating documents and spreadsheets. Also, if you're really a stickler for the full Adobe Flash-enabled Web experience, traditional laptop and desktop computers are still your best bet, offering more flexibility and compatibility for all of the web's many formats (especially when it comes to video content and games).

The iPad 2 isn't a smartphone replacement, either. To point out the obvious, the iPad simply doesn't fit in your pocket. Today's smartphones do more than connect us to the world--they're extensions of us. If it doesn't fit in your pocket, it's not going to stay with you all day, and it will never be as personal.

It's also worth mentioning that the iPad is not a 4G device, meaning that it doesn't take advantage of the latest generation of high-speed cellular data networks. Several manufacturers, including Motorola, Samsung, LG, and RIM, are promising 4G-network-compatible tablets in 2011. Will 4G be the feature that gives iPad alternatives the edge they need to oust Apple as the top tablet maker? Honestly, we don't know yet, but it seems to be the bet the competition is making.

Apple's aces

The App Store built into every iOS device is Apple's secret weapon. Any tablet can offer a fun experience right out of the box, but it takes a steady stream of interesting, affordable apps and games to keep people glued over the long haul.

When Apple debuted the iPad in 2010, it also gave developers the tools and guidelines needed to create a new breed of larger, tablet-optimized apps. Since then, more than 65,000 apps have been made just for the iPad. By contrast, competitors such as Google, RIM, and HP are just now starting to create their catalogs of tablet-optimized apps, and the chances of them catching up are slim.

For the end-user, the quality and selection of apps made for the iPad represent a kind of fountain of youth for the device, imbuing it with new uses and capabilities whenever you tire of the old ones. It also helps that Apple's App Store, iTunes Store, iBooks Store, and iTunes software all run off a common user ID, making account set-up and purchases just about as effortless as it can get.

The main menu app for Apple's iTunes store is also one of these ""sleeping giant"" features we take for granted. Here you have one-touch access to what is now the #1 music retailer in the world. The world. On top of music selections, you also get movie and TV downloads as well as rentals priced as low as 99 cents. Podcasts, university lectures, music videos--it's all there, and no other competitor has it, or anything close.

To be fair, when it comes to core features such as e-mail, Web browsing, media playback, maps, and contacts, many of Apple's competitors (most notably Google and its Android Honeycomb tablets) are quickly matching the iPad. If third-party apps, games, and media downloads aren't your thing, there are many competent tablets on the market worth considering and more on the horizon. On the other hand, if apps and media aren't your thing, you may want to consider skipping a tablet altogether.

The first beta of Opera 10.60 was released only two weeks ago, and on Thursday it graduates to a wide release and sheds its beta tag. Opera 10.60 for Windows, Mac, and Linux incorporates security enhancements provided by popular freeware antivirus vendor AVG, improves performance, adds further HTML5 compatibility, and makes a minor but noticeable tweak to the browser interface.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

The new security feature indicates that while Chrome and Firefox are looking to further isolate plug-ins and add-ons, Opera hopes to address the immediate threat from malware-infected Web sites. Opera now comes with AVG's real-time Web threat data feed built in. What this means is that when you encounter a page that's been detected by the AVG network to be malicious, you'll see the warning instead. The network is fed by data supplied anonymously by 51 million AVG users from around the world.

According to AVG's press release, the feature uses multiple techniques to protect users. It uses exploit signatures to detect sites serving drive-by downloads, the AVG Online Shield and contextual analysis to detect social engineering scam-driven viruses, and reputation lists for safeguarding against malicious domains and URLs.

Opera is also claiming the same dramatic performance improvements in version 10.60 as it did in the beta, saying that the browser is 50 percent faster than the previous version using the Peacekeeper test. CNET tests performed on the beta showed it closer to 33 percent faster on that test, which is still a massive improvement, but only 5.6 percent faster on the SunSpider JavaScript test.

Version 10.60 supports several nascent HTML5 features, including the next-generation video and audio codec WebM, geolocation compatibility, Web Workers, and App Cache. This update places Opera at or very close to parity with beta and development versions of Chrome and Firefox. Opera has also created an HTML5-geolocation-powered map showing real-time downloads and active users of Opera.

In other changes, Bing finally makes it onto Opera's default search options list, and Opera has tweaked the ""O"" logo menu that debuted in Opera 10.5 by adding the word ""menu"" to clarify what it's for. The Windows changelog, Mac changelog, and Linux changelog are available at the Opera Web site.",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20031279-12.html,IE9 RC debuts with 'do not track',"February,Am,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"SAN FRANCISCO--The next generation of Internet Explorer is nearly ready for the public at large, as Microsoft announces the release candidate of Internet Explorer 9 at the Hang Art Gallery in San Francisco's Union Square this morning.

A massive list of improvements debuted in the new RC, available for 32-bit Windows 7; 64-bit Windows 7; 32-bit Windows Vista; and 64-bit Windows Vista. Among the most notable enhancements are the new ActiveX filter, expanded support for HTML5 and ""future-tech"" standards, and advertiser tracking protection, which also was introduced this week into a prerelease version of Firefox 4.

The feature changes from the first beta are focused largely, yet not exclusively, on security. Like the Firefox 4 feature, the new ""do not track"" feature will prevent Web advertisers from tracking your behavior using a header-based solution. Unlike Mozilla's implementation of the protection, IE9 uses both the header and customizable blacklists, Internet Explorer business and marketing senior director Ryan Gavin said in an interview yesterday. ""Using only the header is too narrow a solution,"" he said, noting that Internet Explorer also allows users to create a whitelist for sites that people actively want to track online surfing behavior.

If you go to the Gear menu and then the Safety submenu, there's an option for tracking protection. Clicking it opens the Manage Add-ons window and defaults to the new Tracking Protection tab, from which you can add sites that you want to block. Once the feature has been enabled, simply start browsing. If you go back to the list after checking out a few sites, you ought to see that the list has auto-populated. The configurable number below the main list allows you to set your tolerance for being tracked. If you set it to three, for example, the tracking protection will wait until it sees a tracker on three or more sites before blocking it.

Also new is an ActiveX filter, which you can use to block all ActiveX content and then selectively activate it on a per-site basis. For people unfamiliar with why ActiveX technology is potentially dangerous, to function it requires full access to the operating system that the browser is running in. The new ActiveX filter gives you the ability to restrict ActiveX on a per-site basis, with a toggle in the location bar. If you go to the Gear menu and then the Safety sub-menu, you can block all ActiveX content with one click. Then on the right-side of the location bar, click the circle with a line through it to allow ActiveX content to load on a per-site basis.

Performance gains have been dramatic in the IE9 beta with Microsoft's new JavaScript engine Chakra, and the release candidate continues that trajectory. IE9 RC now places right in the same ballpark for speed as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera, its four primary competitors. And according to Microsoft, IE9 actually placed fastest on WebKit's SunSpider test.

Also new in the release candidate is expanded support for HTML5 and other ""future-Web"" technologies. These include support for the geolocation feature, HTML5 semantic tags, CSS3 2D transforms, and support for the WebM video codec. These features are largely present in other browsers, so that they're finally coming to Internet Explorer must be a comfort to developers.

Quite a few minor improvements have been made since the last beta was released, too. The default maximum temporary Internet file size has been increased to 250MB from 50MB, which means that while your cache will be significantly bigger on disk, IE can store more data locally and make it that much quicker to load Web content. Pinned sites have been extended to the trackless private browsing, and you can now set tabs to show on a row below the location bar, which gives them the width of the browser to be displayed. Background tabs have received a Close button, which appears on mouse-over, and Microsoft has tweaked the interface itself to cede more space back to the Web page being displayed. In other words, IE9 RC is thinner than IE9 beta.

While testing the release candidate yesterday, I was pleased to discover that the instability that had plagued the first beta was gone. The release candidate didn't crash once over a six-hour period of use, although it did hang for a few seconds several times. Sites loaded quickly, and most importantly the browser not only felt ready for daily use, but felt like it could stand comfortably next to other modern browsers.",html

SAN FRANCISCO--Android, Google's top developer priority, hogged the spotlight at Google I/O today--in part as the foundation for new Google music and video services.

Among the Google I/O announcements today:

 Google announced Android 3.1, an update to Honeycomb that adds new interface options, lets people plug in USB devices, and sports a movie rental service that works directly from the device. Android 3.1 comes to Motorola Xoom owners today and other tablets later.

 After Honeycomb comes Ice Cream Sandwich in the fourth quarter, which incorporates Honeycomb features but works on phones and Google TV devices as well. Job No. 1 for Ice Cream Sandwich is reducing the fragmentation problem that makes it hard to write one Android app that works on multiple devices, but Google was cagey on new features coming to make that possible. Also coming with Ice Cream Sandwich is a facial tracking technology.

 Google's cloud-based music streaming service arrived, as expected. With it, people can upload their own music collection and stream it to their devices--including to new Android-powered Project Tungsten devices that send music to a person's home stereo system. The service is in invitation-only beta right now in the United States. For a look, check out CNET's Google music slideshow.

 The Android 3.1 update to Honeycomb comes with a movie rental service, including the ability to browse and rent movies directly from a tablet and to cache the movies for watching even if there's no network connection. When people rent a movie, they have to watch it within 30 days, but once they actually start watching it, they have 24 hours to finish. The service begins in the United States but will eventually be launched internationally.

 Google and Samsung gave away 5,000 Galaxy 10.1 tablets to Google I/O attendees. Honeycomb apps are the company's top developer priority, said Android leader Andy Rubin.

 Google wants Android to be the hub for any number of devices--home lighting systems, dishwashers, exercise bikes, and more. In addition, Honeycomb tablets running Android 3.1 will act as USB hubs so keyboards and cameras can be attached.

 Google has some big numbers reflecting Android adoption, including 100 million Android devices activated, 310 devices on sale so far, and 4.5 billion app downloads to date.

 Google says people will be able to customize their own hardware accessories to be controlled via Android, through its Android Open Accessory initiative and the Android Device Kit, which is built on the open-source Arduino. No release date or pricing has yet been announced for the SDK.

The art that graces the cover of this week's New Yorker magazine is entitled ""Finger Painting."" It's the ideal name, since the artist created it using nothing more than his finger and trusty iPhone.

Artist Jorge Colombo designed the scene of a New York City hot dog vendor using an iPhone app called Brushes, software he only started using in February. Created by developer Steve Sprang, the $4.99 program lets anyone from amateur to professional draw and paint using the iPhone as canvas.

In e-mail interviews with CNET News, both the artist and the developer spoke about their background and their inspiration.

As illustrator, photographer, and graphic designer, Jorge Colombo has seen his work published in a variety of venues, from magazines to books to the Web. Originally from Portugal, he moved to the U.S. in 1989 and bounced from San Francisco to Chicago before making the Big Apple his home.

Jorge Colombo

His passion for the city is clear in his work. His iPhone cityscapes show off Manhattan in all its glory, depicting scenes of the Empire State Building, Grand Central Station, and even Katz's Deli, a famous New York eatery. ""I keep gravitating towards the urban landscape,"" he says. ""So many stories behind each scaffolding, each mismatched addition, each broken window, each parked truck.""

Colombo says that ""Finger Painting,"" a familiar Manhattan scene of a hot dog vendor with his customers, is something he drew from life. ""There are countless (numbers) of those carts in NYC, especially in that stretch of 42nd Street. I love the idea of a little restaurant self-contained in a cart, the idea of concentrated systems and kits appeals to me. As proven by my carrying of my studio in my pocket now.""

Working on a small medium like the iPhone poses some challenges, but Colombo rises above them. ""I tend to focus on advantages, not limitations,"" he says. ""I like using my fingers. I like the quick eyeballing of colors. I like the endless Undo function. Wish I had a bigger screen, and long drawing sessions depletes my battery. I'm all the time ducking into cafes or restaurants, forcing myself to consume something while I recharge the phone on a socket to go do more drawings.""

Though people can use a stylus to draw on the iPhone, Colombo says he uses just his finger and finds working this way very organic. His work as an illustrator for 26 years beforehand helped a little. ""The 800-percent zoom doesn't hurt either.""

A video clip showing how Colombo created ""Finger Painting"" details each stroke used to build the evocative image.

Colombo's watercolor and ink paintings have been featured on the pages of the New Yorker, but this is his first work to achieve the cover. It's also the first iPhone-generated art to appear on the cover of any major magazine. The New Yorker promises a new Colombo drawing will grace its Web site each week.

Brushes developer Steve Sprang has long enjoyed working with graphic tools. He hails from Apple where he was a member of the iWork team, responsible for creating the suite's 2D graphics and designing how the user interacts with the on-screen canvas. With his interest in computer graphics and creative tools, he says he's always sought out those types of projects.

Steve Sprang

Sprang initially began work on his Brushes app in March of 2008--it popped up on the Apple Store that August. But a painting program wasn't his original idea. ""Initially, I created a color chooser as a way to get familiar with iPhone development. I figured it might be useful for any number of apps,"" he said. ""Once that was working, though, it seemed obvious to me that I needed to build a painting app. It's a natural fit for the touch screen.""

Since Brushes went live, Sprang says there have been more than 45,000 total downloads. Though the program is designed to be used by anyone, it's brought out the best in a variety of talented and professional artists, whose work can be seen on the Brushes Flickr group.

Sprang says he knew Brushes had potential when he himself created one of its first sample paintings--an apple against a white background. Though he had drawn a bit in the past, he had never painted before and was surprised how well it turned out. ""At that moment,"" he said, I became very excited to see what a properly trained artist could do. I'm still impressed on a daily basis by what appears in the Flickr group. I'm lucky to have such amazing users!""",html

http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-20097648-285/three-apps-for-tracking-hurricanes-on-android/,Three apps for tracking hurricanes on Android,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Hurricane season is open, and that means keeping track of whether these storms will reach your hometown. Following the local news can be cumbersome if you're on the go, so why not use your Android device to help out? Here are three Android apps that can keep you informed on severe weather conditions.

Screenshot by Nicole Cozma

Hurricane Hound

Hurricane Hound is an app designed specifically for tracking storms. Each storm is labeled by name with several icons denoting the path the hurricane is predicted to take. These icons are colored and labeled based on the category rating the storm will be at each location. Storm warnings are also illustrated on the map in the form of colored lines. Finally, the potentially affected area of the storm is noted by a yellow coloring of the map, displaying the other possible trajectories for the storm.

This app is great for the purpose it was designed for; storm directions and strengths are clearly labeled, and it's very easy to pick up the app and understand what it's showing you. Even though you can't see where storms have previously traveled, you can easily pinpoint the current location because there is no old data on the map to obscure it.

HurricaneSoftware

This app is very similar to Hurricane Hound in appearance and features. A notable difference is the inclusion of recorded (as opposed to predicted) readings from previous locations. The storm's current location is indicated by a white circle around the icon, which is colored in a similar fashion to Hurricane Hound.

Instead of the yellow-colored trajectory area on the map, this app uses a connect-the-dots-style path for storms. While this won't show the exact path of a hurricane, it can give you a good idea (and as history has shown, storms can decide to go a completely different direction anyway). Also, the names of storms are hidden until you tap on one of the dots in a trajectory. This can be helpful if a lot of smaller storms are grouped in one area, keeping the map free of clutter.

WPBF Hurricane

Though the phone numbers and shelter locations provided within this app are specific to Florida areas, the other tools can work for people living anywhere. There is also a sister app for the Louisiana area.

Aside from monitoring tools, this app also provides links to news stories and a hurricane checklist to help prepare for the oncoming severe weather. The map in WPBF displays the current location of storms, colored by category rating and your location, but it omits the storm's trajectory. Instead, a threat meter is provided on the main page, which is similar to the usefulness of a visual path. Reading this meter tells you the likelihood of your area being hit by a storm on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 being no danger and 5 being an almost 100 percent guaranteed hit.

This app is an invaluable tool for planning ahead. Having checklists available for preparing your home, family, and pets for hurricanes can be a literal lifesaver--both for veterans of hurricane territory and those new to the region. Also, the inclusion of an easy-to-find and constantly updated newsfeed on storms is a huge plus.

If you're looking for an Android app to monitor storms, you really can't go wrong with any of these. Despite being similar, each app has at least one feature that makes it worth grabbing if you're serious about getting prepared for any storms headed your way.",html

http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20060191-12.html,Why potential LastPass data breach isn't last straw,"May,Pm,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Popular third-party password manager LastPass revealed yesterday that it may well have been hacked and that some e-mail usernames and master passwords may have been stolen. Does this mean it's time to migrate to another password manager, or even abandon the entire concept of online password management for a pen-and-paper solution?

(Credit: Inc.,LastPass)

Given the facts of the situation from LastPass' blog post explaining what happened, I'd say no to giving LastPass the boot, and definitely not to abandoning digital password management for a ""little black book.""

Leaving a paper trail is a horrendous idea for two reasons. The first is that if you lose your book or it gets stolen, it's gone and you've got a statistically tiny chance of recovering it. The other is that the book itself offers zero security. If somebody else sees it, your passwords are compromised even if the book doesn't get stolen. From any angle, it's just a bad idea.

Before I get to why it's OK to stick with LastPass, though, let's review some of the reasons people use third-party password managers in the first place. Though the five major browsers now offer some method of password protection and management, including syncing between mutliple devices, many people have flocked to third-party password protection because it tends to be browser-agnostic. You can access it from any browser, including on your smartphone, and the third-party vendors often provide more features, such as stronger security, password grouping, password generation, password-associated note-taking, and password sharing to trusted individuals.

In fact, one of the best reasons to use LastPass is that it uses 256-bit AES encryption to protect your data, and the company is solely focused on providing password protection. LastPass also uses one-way salted hashes, which is not a potato-based concoction. A ""salted hash"" in cyptographic terms means that random binary numbers are used in conjunction with a password to ensure that the data transfer is legitimate and not being spoofed. It prevents pregenerated password tables from being used to gain access to the system, because the random binary part of the hash would be too large to easily spoof.

LastPass noted in its blog announcing the possible breach that the company has taken the opportunity to implement salted hash 256-AES protection with PBKDF2. This is a very strong manner of encryption, and brings us to why it's still a good idea to continue to use LastPass. Unlike recent high-profile data theft cases involving companies like Sony, Ashampoo, Verizon, and Epsilon, LastPass has been very forthcoming with information on the steps the company has taken to ensure continued user protection. This includes noting that despite thin evidence that the possible breach had affected many customers, LastPass decided to take the precautionary step of resetting everybody's master, and not just those of users on the affected server.

The key paragraph from the LastPass blog post announcing the possible breach is this:

""In this case, we couldn't find that root cause. After delving into the anomaly, we found a similar but smaller matching traffic anomaly from one of our databases in the opposite direction (more traffic was sent from the database compared to what was received on the server). Because we can't account for this anomaly either, we're going to be paranoid and assume the worst: that the data we stored in the database was somehow accessed. We know roughly the amount of data transfered and that it's big enough to have transfered people's e-mail addresses, the server salt, and their salted password hashes from the database. We also know that the amount of data taken isn't remotely enough to have pulled many users' encrypted data blobs.""

So, assuming that LastPass is being forthright and not lying, the following statement also makes sense:

""If you have a strong, non-dictionary-based password or pass phrase, this shouldn't impact you--the potential threat here is brute-forcing your master password using dictionary words, then going to LastPass with that password to get your data. Unfortunately not everyone picks a master password that's immune to brute forcing. ""To counter that potential threat, we're going to force everyone to change their master passwords. Additionally, we're going to want an indication that you're you, by either ensuring that you're coming from an IP block you've used before or by validating your e-mail address.""

Again, assuming honesty from LastPass--which admittedly may be too much for some people--it appears that LastPass is taking extreme measures to protect all its users from what potentially might have been a data breach. Another reason that LastPass might be requiring all users to reset their passwords is that the company doesn't have access to the salt hashes on its own servers. They couldn't see your passwords if they wanted to.

It's this kind of straightforward frankness about data breaches that other companies would do well to learn from. Data breaches are inevitable. There is no such thing as a foolproof system, whether we're talking about security virus definition updates or securing data on a server. But as more and more of our personal data is stored up in the cloud, what will differentiate the responsible corporations and companies from the reckless ones is clear and quick communication about both security upgrades and data breaches.",html

Trend Micro Antivirus+, Trend Micro Titanium Internet Security, and Trend Micro Maximum Security include the overhauled cloud-based Smart Protection Network proprietary engine to protect against viruses, malware, phishing attacks, and other threats.

The suites are notable for the heavy reliance on cloud-based technology and Trend Micro's emphasis on its Smart Scan tech. According to the company, this works by constantly scanning for threats when connected to the Internet, and utilizing locally-cached databases when working offline. The offline database includes protections against viruses and malware that are known to spread by USB keys.

All the bits sent from one WhatsApp user to another are scrambled in a way that cannot be unscrambled by anyone except the sender and the recipient.

This upgrade does not require you to update the app itself (in fact, no new version of WhatsApp has come out in several days). It takes place on the server side. So as long as there is a version of WhatsApp that's compatible with your device, you will benefit from this change whenever you use the app, and your messages are encrypted whether your network is Wi-Fi, 4G LTE, 3G, or Ethernet.

WhatsApp makes its case for privacy

WhatApp's blog does not mention Apple or the FBI by name, instead saying, ""Recently there has been a lot of discussion about encrypted services and the work of law enforcement. While we recognize the important work of law enforcement in keeping people safe, efforts to weaken encryption risk exposing people's information to abuse from cyber criminals, hackers, and rogue states."" CEO Jan Koum adds, ""The desire to protect people's private communication is one of the core beliefs we have at WhatsApp, and for me, it's personal. I grew up in the USSR during communist rule, and the fact that people couldn't speak freely is one of the reasons my family moved to the United States.""

Other options for encrypted messaging

WhatsApp is not the only messaging app to receive end-to-end encryption. For example, Signal Private Messenger (iOS, Android) (originally known as RedPhone) has had that security feature from the beginning. But WhatsApp has by far the biggest reach of your available end-to-end encryption options.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has a privacy scorecard for messaging apps, some of which are still technically more trustworthy than WhatsApp, due to its lack of independent code review. Apps that skip independent review generally do so to protect their trade secrets.",html
http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/a-guide-to-windows-10-security-settings,A guide to Windows 10 security settings,"August,Pm,Tom Mcnamara",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"By default, Windows 10 lets your PC do some things that you might not want it to do. We've walked you through its long list of privacy settings, and now we'll take a look at your system options for security issues like updates, Wi-Fi, antivirus protection, and data backup.

Accessing security settings in Windows 10

The easiest way to reach security settings is to press the Windows key and then click or tap Settings. If you've been to this section before, you'll return to where you left off. To get back to the home window, click the gear icon in the upper left-hand corner. Then click Update and Security.

Windows Update

This is the first subsection under Update and Security. Windows 10 checks for and installs updates automatically, giving you little control, which is unfortunate, because sometimes updates cause instability or even create security holes. The most you can do is manually uninstall an update and then use this tool from Microsoft to tell your computer to ignore that update going forward.

You can also tell Windows to never automatically download and install a driver update from Microsoft. Drivers are the code that Windows uses to recognize the physical components (aka the hardware) of your PC. If a Microsoft-supplied driver appears to be causing you trouble, shut down Windows 10's automatic process by pressing the Windows key, typing ""device installation"" (without the quotes) and clicking the top search result. Then click the second radio button to get a list of options. Select the second option to tell Windows to never install drivers provided through Windows Update. All things being equal, leaving these settings alone will be safer for your PC. But if you're having trouble with a piece of hardware, this is one troubleshooting option. Unfortunately, you can't tell Windows to ignore a specific hardware component -- it's all or nothing.

Back in the Windows Update settings, click Advanced Options to refine how Windows delivers system updates. You can specify a time of day to install system updates or let Windows install when your PC is not in use. If you click ""View your update history,"" there's a link at the top to manually remove a specific update, and a list of error messages below that, if any updates failed to install.

There's also an option to receive Insider builds of Windows 10. This feature allows you to become a beta tester of Windows, but it requires you to log in with a Microsoft account and increases the amount of info that your computer gives Microsoft when you get a system error. From a security perspective, we recommend staying away from beta testing, at least on your main device.

Last but not least, there's ""Choose how updates are delivered."" By default, Windows 10 enables a peer-to-peer (P2P) network to distribute system updates. This takes strain off the company's data centers. It works by using other Windows 10 PCs on your local network, as well as other PCs detected over the Internet and owned by other people. If you turn this feature off, you will always get your updates directly from Microsoft.

While we'd like to help Microsoft conserve bandwidth, it's not ideal from a security perspective to pass a system update through a third party before it gets installed on your PC. There's always the possibility that these files could be tampered with. Microsoft has developed methods for verifying system file authenticity, but we're not inclined to leave P2P updating enabled. Microsoft doesn't give any information about how much of your own bandwidth is consumed by P2P updates, nor does it give you tools to adjust the size of the pipe.

Windows Defender

The second section in Update and Security (in the left-hand pane of the Settings window) manages Windows Defender, an integrated antimalware program designed and maintained by Microsoft. In the days of Windows 7, this was a standalone program known as Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE). MSE started off strong, but these days it doesn't detect and block malware as reliably as apps like Kaspersky or Bitdefender do. You can buy licenses for those at Amazon for a fraction of the retail cost and run them alongside Windows Defender.

The options in this subsection are fine to leave on by default. In fact, you can't fully disable Windows Defender here -- the real-time protection can only be temporarily toggled off, even if you have another antimalware program installed. Windows 10 doesn't specify how long it will wait before its real-time protection is re-enabled.

Backup

The Backup section controls Windows 10's built-in data-backup tools. While it's nice to have this kind of utility integrated, backups you create here are not password-protected by default, so you may be better off sticking to the backup software that comes with an external hard drive. Without passwords, your backups might be vulnerable to unauthorized access if your external drive is stolen or lost.

However, there's a tool in this section for creating a full system image, which is useful when trying to recover from serious errors. To access the tool, click More Options, scroll down to the bottom of the screen and select Advanced Settings, and click System Image Backup in the lower left-hand corner. Click ""Create a system image"" on the left to begin the process. You can create a system image on another drive, a USB thumb drive, or a recordable DVD.

Password-protecting backups

Like File History data backup, the file created by the system-image backup tool is not password protected by default. But if you have Windows 10 Professional, you can do this manually. Right-click a file, select Properties, click the Advanced button, and check the box next to ""Encrypt contents to secure data."" To decrypt the file, you'll enter your Windows password. In Windows 10 Home, the encryption option will be grayed out, and you'll need a third-party tool like WinRAR or WinZip.

None of these options has a password-recovery feature, so your best solution is arguably a password manager that offers password recovery, such as LastPass, Blur (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer), or Dashlane. Store your file passwords in one of these managers, and you'll reduce the possibility of forgetting the password and not being able to access the file. Since these three managers operate in the cloud, you can also access your password database from another device, in case your main one gets hosed.

Activation

The Activation section is pretty small and doesn't have stuff that's directly related to security. But since we're in the neighborhood, we might as well mention that people using the free upgrade to Windows 10 do not need to activate anything. In fact, once you've used the free upgrade on this device, you can do a clean install of Windows 10 using the ISO downloadable from Microsoft.

Ordinarily, a clean install wipes everything, so you may wonder how Microsoft lets you use a full ISO of Windows 10 to do a fresh install on a device that had a free upgrade to Windows 10. Well, when you install the free upgrade, Microsoft makes a record of the device that used the upgrade. This record is permanently linked to that device. So if you decide to wipe your drive later and use the full ISO to re-install Windows 10, instead of installing an older version and applying your free upgrade, the ISO installer will communicate over the Internet to Microsoft, which now has a record of that device installing Windows 10, and Microsoft will let the installation go through and activate.

The For Developers section

For home users, this section allows you to manually install something that would usually only be obtainable from the Windows Store app, such as the Windows 10 version of Minecraft. However, sideloading disables a security check that verifies the installer's authenticity. Since this method could be used to get malware onto your PC, we don't recommend sideloading unless you're prepared to handle the risks.

Managing Wi-Fi Sense

Windows 10 does some unusual things with Wi-Fi that you should familiarize yourself with. Go back to the home window of Settings, click Network & Internet, scroll the right-hand side of the window to the bottom, and click Manage Wi-Fi Settings.

There are two important choices to make here. First is the decision to connect to suggested open hotspots. Since public Wi-Fi is a popular avenue for hackers to tamper with connected devices, we recommend leaving that off. The other setting enables network sharing. Users of Skype, Outlook.com, and Facebook can share access to their Wi-Fi network with people on their friends lists. In turn, you can share this access privilege with your friends on Facebook, Skype, and Outlook.com, depending on what boxes you check when you enable network sharing.

Note that we say ""access privilege"" instead of ""password."" Your Wi-Fi password remains unknown to others using this system. However, making access to your home Wi-Fi as shareable as a tweet is pretty inadvisable from a security perspective, so we'd recommend that you never check any of those three boxes.

If you've given a friend your actual Wi-Fi password, you'll need to take an additional step to prevent them from using Wi-Fi Sense to share access with other people. That requires changing the name of your Wi-Fi network. This setting is controlled by your wireless router's software, not Windows 10, so the exact method of accessing your network name, known as an SSID (Service Set Identifier), varies from one brand to another. But it usually starts with opening a Web browser, navigating to 192.168.0.1, and entering an administrator name and password. When you locate the function to change your SSID, add ""_optout"" at the end of it (without the quotes). So MySSID becomes MySSID_optout.

Letting other people access your Windows 10 device

Let's say you want to let a friend or family member use your Windows 10 device, but you don't want them to mess up your settings or personal files. You can create a guest account that gives them limited privileges. To do that, go to the home Settings window and click Accounts. In the left-hand pane, click ""Family & other users.""

You can create two types of guest account. Adding a family member and identifying them as a child allows you to filter which websites and Windows Store apps they can use. It also provides an activity log to let you monitor your child's activity. A family member added as an adult can change settings on the child's account, but that adult does not have full administrator privileges on this device. Adding a family member requires them to log in with or create a Microsoft account.

The ""other user"" type of guest account doesn't require a Microsoft account, but Windows 10 doesn't look eager to disclose this distinction. You have to insist that this user does not have an email address, and then you get the option to click a link that says ""Add a user without a Microsoft account."" Then you create the username and password.

Cortana and Microsoft's cloud data

Cortana is Microsoft's Siri-like helper that finds information for you based on voice and text input. It's disabled by default, and security-focused users will probably want to leave it that way. Otherwise, it will collect a lot of usage information and store it in Microsoft's cloud, where we don't know how that information will be used. However, accessing Siri's settings does give you a window into what else Microsoft knows about you, and it gives you an option to manage that info. So let's walk through that.

Press the Windows key, type ""Cortana"" (without the quotes), and click Cortana & Search Settings. Click ""Manage what Cortana knows about me in the cloud"" to open a webpage on Bing. Log in to your Microsoft account to continue. This opens up the Personalization menu on Bing. Here, you can clear your ""interests,"" which is a record of the types of things you click when visiting Bing.com and MSN.com and when using Cortana in Windows 10.

You can also clear everything you've ever search for on Bing itself, and clear the data recorded by Cortana in Windows 10 (such as your contacts, calendar entries, browsing history, and location history). Note that the page where you clear Bing's search history also allows you to disable the search history function altogether. You can also clear data recorded in Bing Maps. At the bottom, you'll see options to manage the collected user data that's specific to Xbox, OneDrive, Outlook, and Microsoft's advertising platform.

Microsoft plans to launch the beta of the Internet Explorer browser on Sept. 15, according to a blog post on Thursday.

The software maker has scheduled an event in San Francisco to mark the arrival of the beta, billing the event (and the browser) as highlighting ""the beauty of the Web."" Microsoft also sent packages to reporters containing a variety of art supplies, such as crayons and fingerpaints, inside a box with an IE logo.

That Microsoft is holding a launch event reflects the resurgent importance of the browser and the degree to which Redmond is counting on IE9 to get it back in to serious technical competition with Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

As noted in a story earlier Thursday, the beta needs either Windows Vista or Windows 7 (no XP) and will also require users to swap out their current installation of Internet Explorer. Among the key features of IE9 is its support for HTML5, an improved JavaScript engine, and the ability to tap a computer's graphics chip to accelerate text and image rendering.

Microsoft hasn't said much about the design of IE9, but the company's Ryan Gavin told CNET that the goal of the browser is not to block the view.

""The browser is the theater,"" Gavin said. ""We're not the play.""

Gavin said that Microsoft is hoping to see wide adoption of the beta. ""The beta is not for everyone, clearly,"" he said, ""but if you are comfortable downloading and installing software, I know I am going to want you to try IE9.""

For those who don't want to, or can't, install the beta, Microsoft plans to continue to offer and update its technical preview of the browser engine, which runs side-by-side with earlier versions of IE. The fourth such preview was released last week.

Microsoft's chief operating officer, Kevin Turner, told financial analysts last month that the beta of IE 9 would come in September.",html

They also have the added benefit of raising the competitive bar in computer security by pushing more and better free options to users. Avast Free Antivirus 6, Avast Pro Antivirus 6, and Avast Internet Security 6 all feature the new AutoSandbox and the WebRep browser add-on. (Click the links to get to the download page.)

The debut of the AutoSandbox makes Avast the second antivirus to offer a sandboxing tool for free. Comodo introduced a sandboxing tool in January 2010. Avast's sandbox probably works differently, as Comodo has a pending patent on its version. And certainly, one of the most frustrating things about sandboxing technology is that there are some indications that it doesn't work perfectly.

All that being said, Avast's version automatically places programs into a virtualized state when it suspects them of being threats. It walls off suspicious programs, preventing them from potentially damaging your system while allowing them to run. Avast's sandbox allows the program to run, while keeping track of which files are opened, created, or renamed, and what it reads and writes from the Registry. Since permanent changes are virtualized, so when the process terminates itself, the system changes it made will evaporate.

The company hasn't said whether the virtualized state begins after the program already has access to your system, so it's theoretically possible that it could be compromised. There's not a single security feature in any program that hasn't been been compromised at some point, though, so ""theoretically hackable"" is true of all security features.

You can access the AutoSandbox settings from the new Additional Protection option on the left nav. It defaults to asking the user whether a program should be sandboxed, although you can set it to automatically decide. There's a whitelist option for programs that you always want to exclude from the sandbox, and you can deactivate the feature entirely.

Avast 6 also marks the debut of the program joining (or succumbing to) the browser-security add-on. Security add-ons have a long-standing word-of-mouth reputation for decreasing browser performance, although Internet Explorer 9 Release Candidate's impact meter pegs Avast's plug-in at 0.07 seconds. Avast calls its add-on WebRep.

WebRep works with IE and Firefox out of the box, and plans for a Chrome version soon, according to company representatives. It supports a search result ranking and Web site reputation service that uses a combination of data from Avast's virus labs and user voting to determine a safety score for a site. User voting is a crapshoot of a gamble for many security vendors, although Avast is known for its vast user base and their passionate support of the program, so the company's plans to incentivize user voting could easily work in their favor.

It's important to note that the add-on installs to both Firefox and IE as you install Avast 6. If you don't want it, it's surprisingly easier to remove from within Avast instead of within the browser. Currently, removing the add-on using the browser's interface will cue Avast to re-install the add-on the next time the computer is rebooted.

Many of Avast's small changes are worth noting as well. The Troubleshooting section now comes with a ""restore factory settings"" option, which makes it easier to wipe settings back to a familiar starting point, and comes with the option to restore only the Shields settings. There's a new sidebar gadget for Windows 7 and Vista, and you now can set automatic actions for the boot-time scan. Two features that have trickled down to the free version are the Script Shield and site blocking. The Script Shield now works with Internet Explorer 8 and 9's protected mode. Meanwhile, the paid versions have gained some new features, such as SafeZone, a virtualization feature for secure online banking. Avast has said that the installer has shrunk for all three versions by about 20 percent.

Avast 6 has done much to quash bugs since its release about a month ago. For a look at where it was, you can check out my hands-on take on Avast 6 here.

The heightened competition between Internet security vendors is that both free and paid-only suites are continually struggling to provide the next big thing. Avast 6 looks at both improving its feature set and leveraging its massive anonymously contributed user data base to enhance security, both of which are sensible steps towards stronger home computer security.",html

Instead of typing your password, KeyLemon 2.2 associates your face with your profile, and then regularly checks to make sure that the person sitting in front of the computer matches the image attached to that profile. If it doesn't think they match, the computer takes a photo via the Webcam and then automatically goes to hibernate.

The latest version of KeyLemon introduces a Firefox plug-in called LemonFox that lets users log in to three social-networking services using their Webcam.

Once installed, the program's Wizard will walk you through creating a profile of your face, and link it to your computer's log-in. By default, KeyLemon will check the Webcam every 10 seconds to make sure you're you, although that can be changed in the Control Center's LemonScreen tab. Also, KeyLemon conveniently includes a text bypass for your log-in. This is important because, occasionally, KeyLemon won't be able to recognize you.

The problem is rare, but I found it occurs in two situations. In bright-light settings where the details of your face get washed out, KeyLemon struggles and often fails to recognize your face. There was also occasional failure on laptops resuming from a closed-lid hibernation. One big bug was on laptops jumping from a dock to an undocked state, where the program would freeze the entire operating system and require a reboot. Generally, though, KeyLemon worked more than 90 percent of the time over several days of testing.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

In the Control Center under the LemonScreen and LemonLogin tabs, you'll find a decent array of settings to tweak. These include being able to toggle on and off the log-in feature, configuring the program to run at start-up, program logging, reshooting your profile pic, and creating your own skins.

The Firefox plug-in LemonFox can be used to log you in to your Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter accounts. Just like the main program, LemonFox opens to a tutorial to get you started, and it uses the Webcam to prevent unauthorized access--at least on the computer with KeyLemon installed. It's a good idea to start with the social-networking services, but what I'd really like to see is integration with the Firefox password manager and support in other browsers.

Overall, though, it seems like a solid software tool for adding an extra layer of security to your computer for a reasonable price. The trial limits you to 30 uses, but has no major feature restrictions. A one-year license retails for $19.95, and it's compatible with XP, Vista, and Windows 7.",html

Though it is not a company that puts out several games a year, you know that when Firemint does release something, it's probably going to be good. Last week, Firemint released its latest game, Spy Mouse, and with a mix of line-drawing fun and excellent production values, it has already reached No. 1 in the iTunes App Store.

(Credit: Screenshot by Jason Parker/CNET)

Spy Mouse (99 cents - see note at bottom) is a line-drawing stealth game that challenges you to draw a path for your mouse through dangerous environments in order to steal cheese. You play as Agent Squeak, a crafty little mouse who uses holes in walls and strategically placed furniture to keep himself hidden from patrolling cats. In each level, you try to draw a path with your finger to direct Agent Squeak to blocks of cheese without alerting the cats. Bonuses are given for getting the cheese in the least amount of time, using the least number of drawn paths, and never alerting the cats to your presence. You'll need to succeed at all three to complete a perfect level.

Spy Mouse is a challenging and addictive game that has that ""one more level"" quality to keep you coming back for more, but the overall atmosphere is what makes this game a must-have. What with the '60s-style camera transitions and jazzy spy-TV-show music, we couldn't help but smile as we tried to avoid cats and solve the game's many cheese-stealing puzzles. The game comes with six unique worlds with several levels to complete and a boss fight at the end of each world that will challenge your Spy Mouse technique. There are also items to pick up that will increase your speed and other bonuses along with hidden levels to grab extra cheese that add to the fun. When a level is particularly difficult, you have the option to pay 99 cents from within the game and get Kiska, a cat that takes care of the other cats in your way, but we never saw the need.

Spy Mouse is an excellent and unique pick-up-and-play game with polished visuals and an immediately recognizable espionage-genre ambiance. With its challenging gameplay, beautiful cartoon graphics, and exciting music, it's easy to recommend this game to everyone.

As the third game in Firemint's megapopular catalog, Spy Mouse has already taken the No. 1 spot in the iTunes App Store. Even after playing for only a few minutes, we think it will be easy to see why Firemint's games keep being hits.

LAS VEGAS--A 10-year-old hacker who goes by the pseudonym CyFi revealed today at DefCon 19 a zero-day exploit in games on iOS and Android devices that independent researchers have confirmed as a new class of vulnerability. The girl from California first discovered the flaw around January 2011 because she ""started to get bored"" with the pace of farm-style games.

Speaking to CNET about an hour before her presentation, CyFi said, ""It was hard to make progress in the game, because it took so long for things to grow. So I thought, 'Why don't I just change the time?'"" Most of the games she discovered the exploit in have time-dependent factors. For example, planting corn might take 10 real-time hours to mature in the game. Manually advancing the phone or tablet's clock forced the game further ahead than it really was, opening up the exploit.

She is not revealing at this time which games are affected because of reasonable disclosure, thus giving the vendors that make the affected games a chance to respond.

While many games will detect and block this kind of manipulation, CyFi said that she discovered some ways around those detections. Disconnecting the phone from Wi-Fi made it harder to stop, as did making incremental clock adjustments.

CyFi's mother, who must remain anonymous to protect her daughter's identity, told CNET that at the end of CyFi's presentation at DefCon Kids they would offer a $100 reward to the young hacker who found the most games with this exploit over the following 24 hours. The reward is sponsored by AllClearID, a identity protection company that is also sponsoring the DefCon Kids. This is the first year of DefCon Kids programming at the conference, a reflection of the fact that members of the hacking community are getting older and raising families.

Already an artist who has performed an improvised, 10-minute-long spoken word piece in front of 1,000 people at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, a Girl Scout, and a state-ranked downhill skier, CyFi revealed that she was only a little bit nervous about having to speak in front of the 100 or so expected attendees. She admitted that while it was probably different publicly speaking about a topic with such a specific focus, it would be hard for her to imagine what those differences might be. ""Well, I haven't done it yet,"" she said.",html

What was Apple thinking? The company made its name designing delightful user interfaces that just work, and while iTunes has always seemed like a bit of an afterthought--especially on Windows--compared with Apple hardware, Ping seems particularly rushed and half-finished. Especially in comparison with the last major music-related feature addition, Genius in iTunes 8, which had a pretty strong ""wow"" factor at launch.

Screenshot

When you sign up for Ping, it asks you to create a profile and by default selects 10 favorite songs to display there. But Ping doesn't gather these songs based on your ratings or frequency of playback. Instead, it sticks to songs that you've downloaded from iTunes. Yes, I downloaded a Cheryl Crow song once (it was free, it was for my wife, whatever excuse you want to accept), but that doesn't mean she's one of the 10 artists I want to represent me in public. Fortunately, you can populate your own list of 10 songs--but only from songs that are available for sale (and preview) on iTunes. Meaning no Beatles.

Once you're signed up, it gives you a list of suggested artists to follow. Right now, the list has 14 pop/rock artists, none of whom are very interesting to me. (Enough Lady Gaga already, please.) That's OK, though, as it also lets you search for artists to follow. Except after I conducted about a dozen searches of rock and pop acts with tens of millions of record sales (Led Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac, Neil Young) and more obscure indie favorites (Animal Collective, Mr. Bungle) only one showed up--Pink Floyd. Worse yet, I tried to follow somebody claiming to be Bruce Springsteen from New Jersey, but it turned out to be another user spoofing the Boss. (There should be a rock and roll jail for such crimes.)

The lack of participation at this early stage is understandable, as Apple probably had to sign deals with artists prior to launch. But for artists not in the system, Apple should have linked to their iTunes bio, pictures, or something. Instead, you get an imposingly blank page with ""Your search had no results."" How many times will users be willing to see this page before giving up?

Missed opportunities like this abound. When I click on ""My Reviews,"" an error message pops up saying that ""this person"" (uh, that's me!) doesn't have any reviews. I'd like to write a review, but it gives me no information on how to go about it. Another example: I sent an e-mail invitation to my colleague inviting him to follow me, but when he accepted, I got no notification. He simply appeared in the ""People Who Follow Me"" tab. And unlike Facebook, where accepting a friend creates a two-way relationship, Ping is one-way only--I had to send him a second message before I could start following him.

I'm sure that Ping will improve over time, especially as more of my friends jump aboard. That's often how Apple rolls--release, then iterate. In the meantime, if you want to follow me, search for Matt Rosoff. I'll follow you back.",html

Editors' note: Apple made iOS 4 available on Monday, June 21. The download is free for both iPhone and iPod Touch users, but it is incompatible with first-generation models of either device. The iPhone 3G will support most iOS 4 features except multitasking and home screen backgrounds.

Apple kicked off an action-packed week today with the full release of iOS 4, its newest operating system for iPhone and iPod Touch devices. Though we've been playing with the developer's version on an iPhone 3GS since April, we wanted to wait for the real deal before offering our official take. And from what we can tell so far, our original positive impressions hold true. That's not say that everything is perfect, but iOS marks a significant and welcome jump in the iPhone's evolution.

In fact, we'll go so far as to say that iOS 4 is just as significant a development as Thursday's release of the iPhone 4 . Naturally, new hardware tends to get the biggest spotlight, but iOS 4 brings a handful of crucial features--like multitasking and a unified e-mail in-box--that Apple's products have lacked for far too long (three years too long, to be exact). Indeed, it's always nice when we can check off a box on our ""iPhone wish list,"" particularly when those additions are commonplace on competing smartphones. We also welcome the smaller changes--iOS 4 is set to offer up to 100 new features--even if they're not particularly glamorous. We'll continue to root around for those tiny things in the coming days and will list additional revisions here as we find them.

Multitasking

Though you've always been able to multitask with native iPhone features like the music player, the option is now available for third-party apps. Your primary access point is a multitasking menu that's accessible by double tapping the Home button. Once there, you'll see a list of currently running applications along the bottom of the display that you can scroll through using a sideways finger swipe. The pop-up menu shows only four apps at a time, and we're still investigating whether you're limited as to how many apps you can open at once.

Managing the multitasking menu couldn't be easier. To open a running app, scroll though the menu and tap its icon once. When you're ready to end an app, first use a long press on the related icon and then click the tiny delete icon in the top left corner. Switching among apps is a simple process as well: as you move back and forth, you'll return to the exact point you left.

But is it real multitasking?

As you'd expect, Apple's multitasking works a little differently than on other smartphones. Instead of having all device resources available to every running app, iOS 4 lets only seven app services run in the background. These include audio (you'll be able to play Pandora radio, for example), VoIP services like Skype, GPS/location for apps like TomTom, push notifications, local notifications (those that don't to have to go through a server), task completion (users get an alert when a process is finished), and fast app switching (apps essentially hibernate not to use the CPU). According to Apple, this arrangement will have less of a drain on resources like battery life and memory than if it gave developers free rein. Also, pausing most background apps will free the system from having to juggle resources and kill stalled applications.

Though some have complained that the built-in limitations mean that iOS 4 doesn't have ""real"" multitasking, we think ""incomplete"" is a better description. Granted, you can't run everything in the background, but iOS 4 does allow you to run certain features from multiple apps simultaneously. If that isn't multitasking, then we don't know what is. What's more, it wouldn't be the first time Apple limited features or took longer with development in order to produce a desired customer experience. You may not agree with such a philosophy, but Apple has always been honest about pursuing it. Like with so many other things in technology, it comes down to what works best for you.

Nice, but not miles ahead

On the whole, we were quite pleased with the multitasking experience. As it has a talent for doing, Apple has presented the feature in a slick, easy-to-use manner. It performed beautifully without ever crashing or freezing the phone; it didn't appear to negatively affect our iPhone 3G's battery (we'll follow up with more-thorough testing in that regard once we get an iPhone 4); and it accomplishes what it sets out do. But even with strong points, we wouldn't agree that it's the ""the best"" way to multitask (a common Apple claim). It may save you a few clicks, but other approaches--such as the ""deck of cards"" interface on WebOS --continue to impress. Similarly, though limited multitasking may result in more-efficient power management, we'll have to run comparison testing with other smartphones before we can agree.

We also don't share CEO Steve Jobs' view that Apple's solution isn't a task manager. When he unveiled iOS 4 in April, Jobs took a dig at Android and other operating systems that require you to close background applications that might be slowing down the phone. ""In multitasking, if you see a task manager...they blew it,"" he said. ""Users shouldn't ever have to think about it."" Fair enough, but we think it's a matter of semantics. As with most task managers, the iOS 4 multitasking menu allows you to scan through running applications and close any that you're no longer using. Granted, you may not have to kill frozen applications as often as you would on, say, a Windows Mobile phone, but you still have that option. We also found usability quirks that are common with task manager apps. Pressing the Home button once, for example, simply sends an app to the background; it does not end it completely. To do so, you'll need to open the multitasking menu, find the related icon, and end it there.

Home screen folders

Though we love apps as much as the next person, we've become tired of scrolling through several pages of iPhone home screens. Thankfully, that has changed with the addition of home screen folders. This is another common feature that competing devices have long offered, so it's nice to see Apple stepping.

To get started, use a long press on the home screen so the icons ""jiggle."" When your icons are dancing (they'll also have a tiny delete icon in the corner) you can take an app and drop it on top of another to create a folder. The folder will then appear as a square with tiny icons of the included app inside. Tap the folder to access the included apps and get an expanded view of the folder's contents. Alternatively, if you want to remove an app, just drag it back to the home screen.

Thankfully, you're awarded a fair amount of flexibility for folder organization. You can add as many folders as you like, change the default folder name, and add both related and unrelated apps. Surprisingly, we could even group legacy features like the Weather and Stock applications into a single folder. The process is easy, though we wouldn't say it offers a huge change from the equivalent experience on Android. And really, Apple, we're limited to just 12 apps in one folder?

E-mail changes

Though the iPhone always has been a functional e-mail machine, we never enjoyed switching back and forth among multiple accounts to read new messages. Fortunately, iOS 4 has a new unified in-box that is accessible under the ""Mail"" option on your home screen. Listed above your individual in-boxes is a new option for ""All inboxes,"" which contains messages from multiple accounts. You can't access individual folders from the universal in-box, but you can delete and move messages. Here again, it works well, but it's not vastly superior to how competing OSes handle the same process.

Other e-mail changes include the capability to add multiple Exchange accounts, organize e-mails by thread, jump directly to individual in-boxes, and open attachments with a preferred app. All are nice, but we'll delve into a couple of our favorites for more detail. E-mails in a thread will now be designated by a small number on the left side of the message header. Clicking the number will take you to a separate screen that lists all relevant messages. It's a nice touch, and we like that you can move or delete messages in the thread. We also like the new option to delete e-mails directly from search results.

Home screen customization

Unlike the previous three features, this change was low on our wish list, but Apple's done a decent job rolling it out. Sure, you always could change the standard black background using a third-party app, but iOS 4 adds the native capability to the iPhone and iPod Touch. First, find the ""wallpaper"" option in the Settings menu and choose either a provided wallpaper or a photo in your camera roll. After making your selection, you'll have the option to set it as the wallpaper for your home screen, the lock screen, or both.

It's all straightforward, but there are a few troublesome trade-offs. First off, we can't fathom why the iPhone 3G didn't get this option. Also, keep in mind that once you ditch the standard black background, there's no way to get it back. You can take a photo of a black wall, the night sky, or a dark room, but that's hardly the same thing. And don't be surprised to find that some of your native wallpapers have been replaced by new options. Apple giveth, and Apple hath taken away.

You'll have to wait for the iPhone 4 to get a 5-megapixel shooter, but iOS 4 adds a 5x zoom for the still camera. When taking a photo, just tap the screen to see the zoom bar. Use your finger to pan in and out, but remember that since this is digital zoom, picture quality will degrade as you zoom in.

Spell check

The iPhone has long had an autocorrect feature that changes words as you type, but we've never considered it to be completely useful. That's why we're bigger fans of the new spell check feature that notifies you of unrecognized or misspelled words with a red underline. It works when you're composing both e-mails and text messages, and you get a list of suggested corrections. We'd like more suggestions, but that's a small point.

Tap-to-focus video

On the iPhone 3GS you can use the tap-to-focus feature in the still and video cameras. We've never found that this feature makes that much of a difference, but it certainly doesn't hurt to have it.

Search text messages

You'll now find a search bar for your text messages. It works just like the search option for e-mails.

Photo gallery

You can organize all images from an event or those that feature a specific friend. For both, however, you'll need to have already used the face recognition options in iPhoto or Aperture and sync with iTunes. One expected change appears to have vanished, however: when we played with the initial beta version of iOS 4 we saw an option in the gallery for rotating photos, but we can't find it again in the final version.

Geolocation

The addition of Geolocations lets you view where you took your latest shots on a map and sort your images by location. This is quite a cool feature, particularly for frequent travelers who like to mark their journeys around the world. But if this isn't your thing, you can turn off location services in the Settings menu.

Safari search

When typing a URL in the Safari browser, you'll see not only the URL title of sites you've visited recently, but also the full Web address. That's a nice touch.

Universal search Web and Wikipedia results will now show up in the Universal Search. It takes a couple of clicks to get them going, but it's convenient.

Playlist

In the iPod player, Apple added an option for creating playlists on the go. We created one in a few steps and added a selection of tunes. What's more, we're always happy when we can do something without going through iTunes.

Bluetooth keyboards

We haven't tested this option yet, but it should be useful for messaging addicts or aspiring novelists.

Birthday calendar

You can keep track of upcoming birthdays with a designated calendar. It's accessible directly from the main calendar option.

Other minor changes

You'll also see a host of other usability and interface tweaks. We haven't located them all yet, but here's what we've found so far.

Now that a double tap of the Home button opens the multitasking menu, you can no longer use the control as a shortcut for a designated feature. As such, the option is gone from the Setting menu. A small price to pay for a new feature, we suppose.

The calculator icon has been resigned. The feature is the same, however.

You can send apps as gifts.

Swiping to the far left of the multitasking menu will reveal music player controls and a shortcut for locking the display rotation.

The location icon in the Google Maps application has changed from a bull's eye to an arrow.

What remains

We have not tested the remaining major iOS 4 features. Once we get an iPhone 4 later in the week, we will use the new applications and expand this section.

Enterprise

Worker bees will get options like enhanced data protection, mobile device management, wireless app distribution, support for Exchange 2010, and SSL VPN from Juniper and Cisco.

iBooks Apple's e-book reader joins Amazon's Kindle app as an option for bookworms. You will be able to access Apple's iBookstore to purchase new content, and if you have an iPhone and an iPad, you can read your book on both devices (with just one purchase) and sync your current page. It looked nifty when Jobs offered a demo of iBooks during his WWDC keynote, but we'll be sure to test it ourselves.

Game Center Coming ""later this year,"" Game Center will include features like a social gaming network, the ability to invite friends to games, leaderboards and achievements, and the opportunity for ""matchmaking"" (setting up two people to play).

What other changes have you found in iOS 4? What do you think of the update?",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-20014175-245.html,"With McAfee deal, Intel to bake in security",,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"James Martin

In the future, you may not have to buy antivirus software for your laptops and mobile devices if Intel is able to live up to the promise of integrating technology from acquisition target McAfee, experts said on Thursday.

In announcing its plans to acquire security company McAfee for $7.68 billion, Intel executives said they see security as being as critical to computing as performance and connectivity and that they plan to combine security with its hardware and expand further into the mobile market.

While Intel has been pushing more and more functionality down into the chips, a marriage with McAfee will mark a shift away from the security firm's traditional product strategy, experts told CNET.

""Delivering security in Intel products and platforms is a huge departure from the way McAfee has delivered security technology in the past, as an add-on software product to an insecure platform,"" said Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer at Veracode. ""This is where security needs to be, baked in.""

The strategy dovetails nicely with the fast adoption of mobile devices and the more guarded move to cloud computing, where data is stored on remote servers instead of on local computers and accessed over the Internet, he said.

""I think this acquisition shows the critical importance of security in our now mobile, increasingly cloud-based, everything-always-connected world,"" he added. ""Everyone building hardware and software needs to be thinking about the security of those products from the very beginning of their design, and customers are going to demand it. Anything less is not going to cut it in the computing environment of today.""

For businesses in the mobile security market, the deal is seen as further validation that they are on the right track.

""Intel's acquisition of McAfee signals to the industry that smartphones and other connected devices are joining the web of devices we trust with critical data and that these devices need to be protected,"" said John Hering, chief executive of Lookout. ""We have seen threats rising across the major mobile platforms and expect this trend to increase as mobile devices continue to become the dominant computing platform.""

Don't expect to see security software hardwired onto the chip, said Tim Bajarin, president of analyst company Creative Strategies. Rather, there will likely be a bridge on the core CPU (central processing unit) to a security element, much like there are bridges to additional graphics chips and modems, he said.

""This particular deal allows Intel and McAfee to work together to tie future generations of software security to the processor via some sort of SOC (system-on-a-chip) solution,"" Bajarin said. ""Today if a hacker wants to come into a system it almost always is done through software. But Intel and McAfee are capable of adding even another level of security, which would make a hacker have to break the hardware code as well as the software code.""

McAfee will still sell antivirus and other security software, but their work with Intel could change the technology landscape fundamentally down the road, according to Bajarin.

""Intel becomes their strategic partner for them to innovate with on next-generation security software that can go all the way down to the chip level, and that has not been done yet by anybody,"" he said. ""It will be fascinating to watch not only how they innovate, but how they go about securing everything from servers and PCs to wireless devices. That will be their challenge.""

Marc Maiffret, chief technology officer at eEye Digital Security, predicted Intel would add the security in hardware at the device level but not necessarily at the chip level, while eventually phasing out McAfee's software-based products.

""TVs and other devices and cars continue to have more and more embedded Internet connectivity and really are becoming computers, and Intel sees the opportunity to bring McAfee's intrusion prevention and antivirus across all the devices,"" he said. ""Intel was in the antivirus security market in the late '90s with the LANDesk product, but they sold it off to Symantec, so they definitely are not going to be getting back into that classic security software business.""

Several analysts questioned why Intel executives felt they need to acquire McAfee to get the security enhancements in future products when they already have development partnerships with McAfee and others.

""I think it's going to be more of a chipset assist than embedding everything in the chip,"" said Josh Corman, research director for enterprise security at The 451 Group. ""And many of those opportunities will be open to McAfee's competitors...and have been happening with joint development. They are going to continue to have multiplatform support.""

Peter Firstbrook of Gartner was similarly skeptical.

""If Intel creates some firmware hooks for McAfee to exploit, then other security vendors can exploit those APIs as well,"" he said. ""Most significantly, all the antimalware vendors have had security products for cell phones for years, but nobody has been willing to pay for it because the threat environment has been relatively benign and the ISPs or device manufactures are building security into the network or the device.""

The shift to ""baked-in"" security and the focus on integration that the deal will require will definitely impact McAfee's existing business, Chris Silva, a senior vice president of research and service delivery for research firm IANS, predicted in a blog post.

""We'll see a stagnation of innovation for McAfee's existing product line and a drain of talent who leave the company seeking greener pastures at smaller, more-focused vendors that are iterating on a product and security approach,"" he said.",html

To recognize those software programs that have dominated the Most Popular list for this year, we've compiled the total download counts for the products in the Download.com catalog in the year 2010, and we've ranked the top-10 biggest, for both Windows and Mac.

One notable program not on the list deserves mention. The popular file-sharing program LimeWire has been a staple of the Most Popular list for several years, but the controversial software met its end in 2010. Amid legal pressures and a court injunction, the LimeWire service shut down October 26, apparently for good. Although LimeWire saw enough downloads to be considered a Top 10 Download of 2010, we have removed it from the list based on its end-of-life status.

Software publishers who receive the Top 10 Download of 2010 distinction will have the privilege of displaying their accomplishments to the world with a special badge designed to commemorate the achievement. Look for this badge around the Web.

From free security tools to innovative screen-sharing apps and Web video software, this year-end list of the most popular Windows software on our site packs a mighty collective punch. Learn more about the top-10 biggest downloads of the year and download them yourself, and find out at the bottom which honorable mentions barely missed the cut.

No. 10: Camfrog Video Chat

Launched in 2003, Camfrog Video Chat has pioneered a number of innovations in instant messaging over the past decade. Camfrog users can chat with text, audio, and/or video, and can directly share picture files of up to 100MB. Most distinctively, Camfrog lets users join thousands of public chat rooms to chat and interact with other people.

Camfrog Video Chat received 14,155,432 downloads in 2010, making it the 10th most popular Windows software on CNET Download.com.

No. 9: TeamViewer

This screen-sharing and file-transferring utility makes it easy for you to cede control of your screen to a helpful IT assistant anywhere in the world...or take over Uncle Bob's computer to clean it after he loads up 39 forms of adware. Logging in to TeamViewer gives you access codes and passwords that let you easily set up a shared connection for remote support, presentation, file transfer, or VPN. Completely free for personal use, the program vaulted up the Most Popular list in 2010 and may be headed for an even higher rank next year.

TeamViewer received 15,722,955 downloads in 2010, making it the ninth most popular Windows software on CNET Download.com.

No. 8: WinRAR

What's a RAR file, you ask? Well, it's a roshal archive file, of course. Originally developed in 1995, Eugene Roshal's compression software, WinRAR, has emerged from back channels in recent years to become the most popular archiving software on the site. The term ""WinRAR"" has even become Internet slang for ""winner."" The RAR file became popular with multimedia users for its better compression ratio for certain music and photo file types, and the shareware WinRAR application itself has evolved into full-featured archive software. Despite the explosion in popularity, WinRAR is still developed by Eugene Roshal. His brother Alexander runs the business side of Win.rar GMBH.

WinRAR received 19,431,244 downloads in 2010, making it the eighth most popular Windows software on CNET Download.com.

No. 7: Advanced SystemCare Free

Formerly known as Advanced WindowsCare, this suite of utilities from IObit offers scads of options for clearing out the detritus that can accumulate on Windows machines. Registry cleaning was the original focus of the app, but the program also removes other junk files and detects and removes spyware. A particularly helpful feature for some is Smart RAM, which lets users monitor and manage their RAM usage. The program also lets users scan for hijacked Windows settings, and the premium version adds scheduled scans to the mix.

Advanced SystemCare Free received 19,544,950 downloads in 2010, making it the seventh most popular Windows software on CNET Download.com.

No. 6: Ad-Aware Free Internet Security

Originally released in 1999, Lavasoft's Ad-Aware software has achieved an indelible presence on the Download.com site, immediately attracting users with its straightforward approach to detecting and removing adware. The flagship software was No. 1 on CNET Download.com's Most Popular list for a good while in the 2000s. The platform has expanded in recent years and now offers three main versions of its original protection--Ad-Aware Free Internet Security, Ad-Aware Pro Internet Security, and Ad-Aware Total Security--as well as variants for businesses and gamers.

Ad-Aware Free Internet Security received 20,375,957 downloads in 2010, making it the sixth most popular Windows software on CNET Download.com.

No. 5: Malwarebytes Anti-Malware

As the new kid on the security block, Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware has made a big splash in a short time. Released in January 2008, the free software has already become one of the ""go-to"" tools of savvy Windows users. It was designed to find malware and rogue software that other security programs often miss, and based on its growing user base and adoption as a backup security service, it seems to be very successful so far. Comprehensive definition files and speedy, accurate scans kept the program in the top 10 of the Most Popular list for most of the year.

Malwarebytes Anti-Malware received 25,799,006 downloads in 2010, making it the fifth most popular Windows software on CNET Download.com.

It may not look like much, but this niche application certainly does what it says on the tin. YouTube Downloader transfers video from the YouTube Web site to your local drive, then converts those videos into formats you can enjoy on your desktop, notebook, iPad, phone, or whatever fancy device you've got that plays video. The program stays in sync with changes to the YouTube service, updating quickly after major site updates. The simple and effective nature of the app has made it a recent mainstay on the Most Popular list.

YouTube Downloader received 30,068,100 downloads in 2010, making it the fourth most popular Windows software on CNET Download.com.

The first product from the big A-list top 3 security apps is Avira AntiVir Free Personal Antivirus. Created in Germany back in 1988, Avira's scheduling features led the way for user customization, and now the program allows users to tweak it even more to get a personal solution that works for them. The Premium version of Avira adds useful features such as e-mail scanning and a Webguard system for detecting malicious Web sites, but tons of users find that the free version suits them fine.

Avira AntiVir Free Personal Antivirus received 42,165,868 downloads in 2010, making it the third most popular Windows software on CNET Download.com.

The longtime music-player look might be gone, but the reliable protection of Avast antivirus software keeps going strong. Avast has been around for more than 20 years now, and it has been a big user favorite on Download.com for most of those years. Known for providing a strong level of security on Windows machines for free, Avast took on a whole new look in the beginning of 2010 with version 5, along with new community features that take advantage of the power of its huge user base. Through the year, Avast challenged AVG for the top spot on the Most Popular list.

Avast Free Antivirus received 52,648,408 downloads in 2010, making it the second most popular Windows software on CNET Download.com.

AVG Anti-Virus Free Edition is the biggest program in the CNET Download.com universe right now, commanding well over a million downloads every week. It has become a ubiquitous presence on Windows machines around the world. AVG started out in Czechoslovakia as a small program from Grisoft named Anti-Virus Guard, and it has slowly and surely become one of the global leaders in the security industry. Although it has a bevy of worthy competitors in the security category, AVG reigned supreme in 2010 and shows little signs of slowing down.

AVG Anti-Virus Free Edition received 84,317,112 downloads in 2010, making it the most popular Windows software on CNET Download.com for 2010.

http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-20010560-2.html,"Evernote gets built-in, third-party app directory",,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"SAN FRANCISCO--Web-based memory service Evernote on Wednesday unveiled what it's calling the next phase of its business with something called ""The Trunk.""

The Trunk is both a directory of third-party sites and a set of tools that can be integrated into the Evernote service to bring additional functionality. According to Evernote CEO Phil Libin, who held a press conference about the new offering here, The Trunk is not an app store, per se, but it will let other companies more easily bring features to the product that Evernote itself could not.

Libin said more than 2,000 partners are taking advantage of the company's APIs. However, at launch, The Trunk will contain just 100 items from 67 different companies. These are split up by category to serve both mobile and desktop Web users.

This built-in directory is being rolled out to Windows, Mac, and Web versions of Evernote on Wednesday, followed shortly thereafter by iPad, iPhone, Android, and BlackBerry clients. Some of the initial partners include: Nitro PDF, which now offers a ""send to Evernote"" option in its software; Seesmic, which Evernote is working with to let its users export notes to the service; and Dial2Do, which is offering a voice transcription service that can transcribe audio notes into text notes, then save them to a user's Evernote library.

When users want to add one of these features, or simply browse third-party Evernote-integrated services, they'll be able to simply click the new Trunk button, which opens up the directory within the Evernote application:

Evernote

For now, any paid service option from one of these third-parties will be done on that company's site, but Libin said a release later this year will include a built-in payment system so that users don't have to leave the app. The company also plans to add revenue sharing and an affiliate program for third-parties to make money off being featured in the directory.

Along with new features, the Trunk will also serve as a place for content providers to offer what the company is calling ""branded notebooks."" These are pieces of content like articles and features from publishers--including California Home and Design, BlackBook, and O'Reilly's Make--in the form of Evernote files that can be viewed alongside a user's own Evernote notes. Libin explained it as a chance for users to ""supplement professional content with [a user's] own thoughts and memories.""

Evernote

Besides the new Trunk feature and branded notebooks, Libin unveiled a new way for groups to work together. Evernote will now be able to collage shared items together into one folder so that users in different locations have the most up-to-date version. Libin explained it as one of the next steps in making Evernote friendlier for business and education users.

In the future, Libin says semantic analysis tools, templates, educational tools, and even games will make their way to the Trunk directory, as well as tighter integration with outside social networks. ""The Trunk is a bridge to the social Web,"" Libin said.

Evernote says it's now up to 3.7 million users since launching in June of 2008. In that time, its users have saved 145 million notes, which Libin said works out to 312 new ones every minute. While the service is free, it does have a premium subscription that costs $5 a month. Libin says that more than 80,000 of its users are currently premium subscribers--a number that has grown every month for the past two years.

According to Libin, there's also been tremendous growth in the number of iPad users, which jumped from 9 percent of mobile users to 18 percent in just one month. He also said that Google's Android platform has made considerable gains in its march to reaching 14 percent of mobile users, and as a result it's requiring more of an investment. ""We've more than doubled our Android team, and will be extending our efforts there dramatically,"" Libin said. ""We think over the next year, that the iOS and Android are the two main competitors.""

Evernote is currently available on 12 different platforms, and in 16 different languages. Of that, Windows users still dominate on the desktop side at 50 percent of total users, followed at 37 percent by Mac users. On the mobile side, iPhone and iPod Touch users account for the majority share at a combined 62 percent of total users.

I found a couple of new task management apps recently that add something extra to the category. But using them made me realize that an old favorite of mine still stood up to the test of time and remains a great choice for lists and tasks.

It's no secret that many people like to use lists to get through daily projects, but when you have a task manager on your iPhone, you get handy additions like alerts, notifications, and editable tasks when your goals change. Whether you're just making a grocery list or planning a big business project, a good task management app can focus your efforts and keep you on point for success.

This week's iOS apps are all to-do-list managers that go the extra mile to simplify your projects. The first is an old favorite of mine that separates tasks into color-coded tabs and lets you store notes and ideas. The second turns your task list into a role-playing game with experience, leveling, and loot to reward your hard work. The third relies on simplicity and excellent design to make task management easy.

Awesome Note ($3.99) lets you manage messages, memos, and ideas in several unique ways. An intuitive interface lets you use themes to help categorize information the way you want and get to the information you need quickly.

Awesome Note includes a few demo categories (shown as folders) that you can use to see how your notes and info will be laid out. You can create new folders by hitting the add folder button in the lower right, selecting your preferred color, and adding a title. Opening a folder displays your notes for that category laid out as thumbnails so you can quickly find the specific note you want. You can also configure the program to display to-dos as a running list or as a separated list with completed items on top.

Once you have your category folders set up, simply open a folder, add a note, and start typing using the regular portrait view or in landscape mode by turning your iPhone sideways. You can also customize your notes by choosing from a wide variety of themes and fonts. When you're finished, you can easily drop your note into other category folders or e-mail the information to whoever you want. The interface is extremely intuitive making it no trouble to get started organizing your notes and to-do lists right away.

The folder-based note management and customizable themes make Awesome Note a worthwhile option if you're looking for an easy-to-use to-do-list manager and note-taking app.

EpicWin ($2.99) has all the features of a regular to-do-list app, but adds a little fun to your daily tasks by turning projects into RPG-like quests. Perfect for the procrastinating gamer, you start by choosing an avatar that will help you ""do battle"" with your tasks. You can tackle your to-do lists as a long-bearded dwarf, a scary skeleton, a giant warrior, and many other classic RPG archetypes.

Once you've picked your avatar, you can start adding tasks to EpicWin and assigning point values that help you gain experience. You have the ability to choose which attribute (Strength, Stamina, Intellect, Social, or Spirit) will be upgraded by completing a task. For example, you might assign 200 stamina points for doing the dishes. When you've finished the dishes, you touch and hold the quest item and the points are added to your character sheet while uplifting adventure battle music plays.

Completing quests adds to your experience and shows your progress on a map, and you'll get loot by reaching various milestones based on completing task quests. Obviously, the loot doesn't really mean anything in the larger scheme of things, but getting rewards for getting through your daily to-dos does give you a feeling of accomplishment.

Despite EpicWin's light-hearted approach to checking off your to-do list, the app has all the tools required for a serious task management app. Buttons across the bottom of the interface allow for easy navigation of your current tasks, completed tasks, your character profile, and loot you've acquired. Like other good task managers, the app supports repeating tasks, displays reminders for overdue events, and allows events to be assigned to specific days. You can also set up tasks with no end date, so even if there's no deadline for completion, you can have aspirational goals listed for when you get to them.

EpicWin is a fun take on how to manage your daily to-do lists. With RPG-like music, cool-looking avatars to choose from, and a leveling up system to keep you focused, this app might be just the motivation you need to get things done.

HQ: ToDo ($1.99) is a very well-designed task manager that attempts to make using the app as easy as possible so you can get to completing your projects. The interface features bright colors and high-contrast fonts, with big buttons that make it easy to navigate your projects quickly.

The main screen lists out your projects, and you can get to lists like simple to-dos or grocery shopping by using the tabs at the top. Tap a project on the main screen to bring up the associated tasks. On the task screen, you'll be able to name a to-do item, set the due date, set up a notification to remind you, assign priority for the task, and add notes. You also have the ability to color-code your projects, so you can instantly recognize them from the main screen.

HQ: ToDo is not the most feature-rich task manager in the iTunes App Store, but I think that's by design--the developers wanted to make task management easy and it shows with the carefully laid out interface.

https://www.cnet.com/products/apple-imac-with-4k-retina-display-21-5-inch-2015,"Apple iMac with 4K Retina display (21.5-inch, 2015) review:",,2015-10-13T05:30:00-07:00,"Last year's addition to the 21.5-inch Apple iMac line caught our attention by cutting the starting price to $1,099 (£899 or AU$1,349) and positioning itself as essentially a MacBook Air recast as a desktop system; the new version for 2015 aims higher.

The flagship device in Apple's just-updated late-2015 iMac line is the configuration reviewed here, stepping up to a gorgeous 21.5-inch 4K resolution display and starting at $1,499 in the US (£1,199 or AU$2,099). Two other base models, at $1,099 and $1,299, retain their 1,920x1,080 displays.

Sarah Tew/CNET

It's worth noting that this is the more literal implementation of 4K in the new 21.5-inch iMac. The display resolution is 4,096 pixels wide, rather than the more common consumer version (sometimes called ultra-high definition or UHD), which has a just slightly lower resolution and is 3,840 pixels wide. That says to us that this system is targeting professional (and high-end enthusiast) photo and video users, who may shoot at that higher version of 4K resolution.

Your big, fancy 4K television set, and every other 4K computer we've seen to date, all adhere to the more consumer-targeted 3,840x2,160 version of 4K. The 4,096x2,304 on this new iMac screen will play any of your 4K content just fine, although the tiny difference in native resolution can have a small scaling effect, which we really only noticed when viewing 3,840-resolution test patterns.

The big secret about 4K is that a lot of people buy a 4K TV, monitor or computer, without really planning on viewing much 4K content on it. It's just the latest spec upgrade to strive for, and most of your video content, and even video games, aren't going past standard 1,920x1,080 high-definition anytime in the near future.

Sarah Tew/CNET

But higher-res screens such as the 4K display here have other advantages. As we saw with the 5K display on last year's 27-inch iMac , individual pixels are practically invisible to the naked eye. On-screen text looks sharper and clearer than on lower-resolution screens, and Apple's expert scaling always keeps apps, menus and icons at a decent size, while giving you the option to mimic the look and feel of several different scaled resolutions. It's the same system Apple has used in all its Retina display models, going back to the MacBook Pro with Retina display.

But there's more to the new iMac than just a higher resolution. The new Retina display supports the wider P3 color gamut versus the more common sRGB (standard Red/Green/Blue) version. Translated for the rest of us, that means the display can show more of the green and red color spectrum (blue, the third leg of the color triangle, is already fairly maxed out under RGB). Apple says it adds up to 25 percent more available colors to display.

P3 is the standard for digital cinema projection in theaters, and for certain photo professionals and film and video experts, this is potentially a big deal. For photo hobbyists, you're unlikely to be able to appreciate the difference, as very little consumer-grade equipment is going to give you files that can take advantage of the wider P3 color gamut (some dSLR cameras, however, can). However, in side-by-side testing using some sample images, the effect was subtle but impressive, with richer reds and greens, and Apple's photo apps as well as third-party programs such as Photoshop, all support color far beyond standard sRBG.

It's little surprise that the new 21.5-inch Apple iMac looks the same as models from the past several years. The basic design language of the iMac has changed little since 2012, when it adopted the current setup of a slim, bowed screen sitting on top of an aluminum stand and minimalist base, a look that still manages to feel fresh years later.

But inside the familiar convex chassis of the iMac, there are some important spec changes for 2015. All three 21.5-inch models jump from Intel's fourth-generation Core i-series processors to newer fifth-generation chips. That's important because these iMacs were previously two generations of CPU behind. However, only the 27-inch iMacs, now all featuring the high-res 5K display, move up to the very latest CPUs, from Intel's recent sixth-generation of Core chips, sometimes known by the codename Skylake.

Sarah Tew/CNET

It's a shame the iMacs are still one chip generation behind, especially with nearly every consumer PC hitting stores this holiday season moving to Skylake chips. But, for a desktop system it's less important, as actual performance changes between generations of Intel chips are fairly modest. Most of the advantage comes in battery life, and for an all-in-one desktop, that's not going to be an issue.

Also new in the 21.5-inch iMac are Thunderbolt 2 ports for faster data transfer (if you have any Thunderbolt-equipped accessories) and some new hybrid hard drive options -- Apple calls them Fusion drives -- combining a small amount of solid-state memory for quick access of frequently used data, with a larger standard platter drive.

Besides the higher screen resolution and new CPUs, the biggest obvious change to the iMac line is the revamped collection of accessories bundled with it. The Apple wireless Keyboard, Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad -- all familiar sights on Apple users' desks around the world -- have gotten their first overhaul in years, and it might be the new feature I'm most excited about.

All three lose their reliance on disposable batteries, instead moving to internal rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. That allows the keyboard and trackpad to slim down, removing the bulbus battery compartments that dominated the previous designs. The Magic Keyboard is smaller and flatter, but has slightly larger key faces. The Magic Trackpad 2 has a larger surface area -- it looks huge compared to the original version -- and now supports Force Touch, just like the pads in the MacBook and MacBook Pro. The Magic Mouse 2 looks the same, but is a hair lighter with better rubber tracks along the bottom.

CNET/Sarah Tew

Overall, this is an important update to the iMac line, as a better-than-HD display feels like table stakes these days for any premium laptop or desktop computer, and the improved color gamut support in the 4K and 5K displays will help keep the iMac line as a top choice for creative pros.

For everyone else, even if you don't regularly view 4K content, a sharp-looking Retina-level display is one of those things that's nearly impossible to give up once you get used to it, and the new 4K iMac is competitively priced with the handful of 4K-display Windows PCs we've reviewed.

If you have a model from the past few years, this isn't a must-have upgrade, but it may certainly be worth picking up the new keyboard and mouse or trackpad to give your older iMac a facelift.

Design and features

You can read any of our iMac reviews over the past three years to get a feel for the long-standing design of this high-end all-in-one. It still manages to look current, although some newer trends seen on the Windows side, from thinner bezels to touch screens, are absent here.

The iMac is dominated by its display, which also houses all the system components. It's still just 5mm thick at the edge, gently bowing out in the back. It looks almost paper-thin when viewed from the correct angle, and still pretty svelte even in full profile, where the rear panel bows out in the center into a gentle bowl shape.

That top section is connected via an adjustable hinge to a curved one-piece stand. If you're not connecting any external USB, Thunderbolt 2, or Mini-DisplayPort devices, and using Wi-Fi instead of a wired Ethernet connection, this is essentially a one-cable setup with a single white power cord in the lower middle of the back panel. As with most Apple computers, this is a sealed system, with no user-accessible components -- unlike the 27-inch iMac, which has an access port for the RAM slots.

Thinner, lighter accessories

The biggest physical change is in the new packed-in accessories, named the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse 2 and Magic Trackpad 2. As before, the keyboard and mouse are included by default, but you can choose to swap in the Trackpad instead of the mouse. With these new versions, however, the adding the Trackpad costs extra. All three are also sold separately, at $79 for the Magic Mouse 2, $99 for the Magic Keyboard and $129 for the Magic Trackpad 2 (all prices in US dollars). Previously, all three first-gem accessories were sold by Apple at $69 each.

That's a big jump in price for the trackpad, but it's easily the most impressive of the new accessories. The pad goes from aluminum-colored to off-white, and looks and feels massive. Apple says the surface area is 29 percent larger. Without the the cylindrical battery compartment, the pad has an even more minimalist look, lying flat on the tabletop with a slight wedge shape.

Sarah Tew/CNET

The Magic Trackpad 2 supports Force Touch, the new touchpad mechanic found in the MacBook and MacBook Pro laptops (a variant is also now in the iPhone and Apple Watch). Force Touch uses four corner sensors to replace the hinged ""diving board"" mechanism found in most touchpads, including Apple's previous ones.",html

Microsoft pulled back much of the scaffolding and secrecy surrounding Windows 8 today at Mobile World Congress. I've been using the Windows 8 beta (download), officially known as the Windows 8 Consumer Preview, for the past week, and it's by far the most integrated and capable operating system Microsoft has ever put out. The question is, will enough people care?

There's a phenomenal amount of change here to discuss, but if you're looking for a quick summary: Windows 8 is a breeze to use. It's tricked out with social networking and synchronization, it's robust enough to handle Photoshop, it gracefully moves from touch to keyboard and mouse, and it's got some top-notch security.

Despite what Microsoft is calling strong interest from hardware manufacturers and developers, however, its impact is still uncertain at best.



Windows 8's predecessor could be summarized in six words: Windows 7 is Vista done right. Windows 8 is a much harder sell for reasons intrinsic to Microsoft itself, its hardware partners, and the whims of consumers.

First, when Windows 8 launches it will be the most ambitious operating system ever, with a workflow that's easy once you learn it, but not necessarily obvious at first blush. Second, more of your Windows 8 experience will be dependent on your hardware than ever before, because it will work on both actual PCs--i.e., desktops and laptops--and tablets.

Last, and this is the one that won't be resolved until Windows 8 starts shipping to consumers in the second half of this year, there's no strong evidence that Windows 8 is what consumers want next. Do people want tablets that aren't made by Apple? Is the tablet more like a larger smartphone, or a thinner laptop? Is there interest in one operating system that offers both casual touch and robust power modes?

Logging on

Windows 8 offers some great log-on options. You can choose to create a local account, but the OS becomes infinitely more useful when you use a Microsoft account. You'll be able to synchronize to it your Windows 8 settings, including Internet Explorer history. This means that when you log in to any other Windows 8 machine with that account, your data will sync, including background settings, address book, other accounts like Facebook and Twitter, e-mail, and instant messaging.

Microsoft

App syncing is planned for the Windows Store, too, while the SkyDrive integration can be used for syncing files.

Beyond sync, once you've logged on for the first time you can change your log-in scheme to a PIN or a picture log-in. The picture log-in is quite cool, and lets you set a photo as your log-in background. You can then customize a quick series of drawings on the picture, made up of a line, a circle, and a dot, to log you in.

I was able to choose my photo log-in from my Facebook photos, which I had synced using the native Photos app that comes with Windows 8. The process was easy, and the photo picker tool in Settings connected through the Photos app to provide access to my Facebook account.

In drawing my log-in on the photo, there were times when it worked on the first attempt, and other times that required multiple attempts. This appears to be more related to the hardware than anything else.

A killer feature that's missing is facial recognition log-ins. The better of these apps have been proven resistant to printed photo hacking, and it would extremely useful to have a Webcam recognize your face and log you in without having to physically touch the computer. At least nobody else has this integrated into the operating system yet, but since third parties like KeyLemon and FastAccess have been working on their versions for a while, expect it to arrive in with the big players sooner rather than later.

Navigating Windows 8: Touch

You can navigate around Windows 8 in two ways, and they work well enough that you can use them simultaneously--assuming you're into that kind of torture.

As we've all seen, Windows 8 is highly grope-able. It wants you to touch it, and frankly touch is the easiest way to get around. Unfortunately, at this point the Windows 8 beta doesn't come with a quick tutorial, and although the workflow is easy, it's not necessarily obvious.

Microsoft

Windows 8 is all about the edges of the screen. You swipe in from the right edge to reveal the Windows 8 charms. These include the instantly recognizable Search, Share, Start, Devices, and Settings. The Start button returns you to the Start screen, which is what you see after you log in and where Microsoft expects most of your activity to take place. Once you've launched at least one app, you can swipe in from the left edge to return to the last-open app.

You can also perform a U-turn from the left edge. Swipe in a little bit, then swipe back to the edge, and instead of pulling forward the last app you used, you'll get a sidebar of thumbnails of your last six apps. At the bottom-left corner of the thumbnail bar is a thumbnail of the Start screen, providing another way to return ""home."" So yes, the familiar Start ""button"" is hidden, but no, it's not hard to get to. It takes about the same effort to get to the Start screen from either edge.

One of Windows 7's better interface features was a split-screen view that you could initiate just by dragging one program's Title Bar to the left or right side of the screen. This has been updated for Windows 8. When you drag an app from the left edge, if you drag it slowly and hold it near either the left or right edge, a vertical separation bar will appear. Once the bar shows up, release the app and it will ""snap"" to the edge. The screen will be split, with one-third for the app you just dragged over, and two-thirds for the previous app.

Tiles, Microsoft's term for its app icons, are arranged in groups. A long press on a tile will select it, and you can change its position or group from there. You can also pinch to zoom out and get a global view of your groups, or create custom groups by dragging a tile to the right edge and releasing it.

Where the left and right edges are global, the top and bottom edges are for the apps themselves. In Internet Explorer, for example, this means that your location bar is at the bottom, and your tabs are up top. On the Start screen, you can get a list view of all your apps. In Mail, you can set up accounts--including non-Microsoft ones like Gmail, create folders, sync and more.

This worked well in almost all cases. The only one that caused me problems was the Calendar, where about half the time swiping from the left moved me back a day instead of pulling me into my previous app. Again, this could easily be a factor of the demo device Microsoft lent me, a Samsung tablet currently available in stores with Windows 7.

Microsoft

The Desktop tile will jump you directly into a Windows 7-style desktop, complete with Recycle Bin, traditional Internet Explorer, Windows Explorer, and taskbar. A keyboard icon next to the system tray forces the Windows 8 soft keyboard to appear, with options for splitting it for vertical orientation, or using a stylus for handwriting recognition. The side edges still work here, though, and it's much more responsive to touch than Windows 7. I was actually quite impressed how even on the older demo hardware that Microsoft lent me, the desktop mode of Windows 8 was incredibly accurate.

Of course, Windows 8's desktop mode is really for easing the transition to the Metro interface. More on that below in the Features section.

Navigating Windows 8: Keyboard and mouse

Because Windows 8 is intended as unified system for both PC and tablet, it works as well with a keyboard and mouse as it does with touch. As with seemingly everything in Windows 8, this too serves two masters. Sure, it gives you the precision required for Photoshop editing or navigating a spreadsheet's cells, but it's also Microsoft waving a big flag that proclaims Windows 8's usefulness. You get touch, mouse-like precision, and keyboard hot keys in Windows 8, Microsoft is saying. If the company could give you a way to interface with the OS via Morse code, that would be in here, too.

Not only do hot keys work, but from what I can tell, all the major hot keys in Windows 7 perform the same functions in Windows 8, as well as some new ones. These include Win+Print Screen to take a screenshot, which then gets automatically saved to your Photos app, or using the Windows key to switch between the Start screen and your last-used app.

One of the best keyboard functions is that you can pull up an app from the Start screen just by beginning to type. It's ridiculously simple and effective: type ""ma"" when on the Start screen, and a list of apps with ""ma"" in their name appear in the center of the screen, but on the right you can flip from Apps to Settings to Files that have the same ""ma"" string.

Not much will happen when you first connect a mouse to Windows 8. As soon as you move the mouse, though, a scroll bar will appear along the bottom edge of the Start screen. You can then use the scroll bar to navigate through your groups, or you can use the scroll wheel for that--so the vertical motion is interpreted by Windows 8 as a horizontal scroll.

Microsoft

Move the mouse to the lower-left corner to reveal your Start screen, or the upper-left corner for your most recently visited app. If you then move the mouse alongside the left edge, it will reveal your other most recently used apps.

The mouse has been enabled for apps, too. So in Internet Explorer, for example, a back navigation arrow appears on the left, and a forward nav arrow appears on the right edge. Mouse to the lower-right corner to see the navigation charms, and then mouse up along the edge to use them.

Right-clicking reveals the ""app edges,"" the app-specific options from the top and bottom screen edges, while a button denoted by a magnifying glass on the far right of the scroll bar zooms you in and out of your groups.

If you're on the lock screen, you click and drag it up to reveal the password dialog. It may sound like a lot that's different from the touch workflow, but it's actually quite simple. You can even use the mouse for your picture log-in.

It's impressive how well Microsoft has been able to replicate the touch workflow with the mouse and keyboard. I don't think we've ever seen the two integrated quite like this before. The multiple ways to interface with the interface also will go a long way toward convincing previous Windows owners and perhaps even skeptics that Windows 8 is all that and a bag of chips. Most importantly, though, both work well with your apps.

Features

From social and security to sync, Windows 8 lives on the cusp of what's expected from a modern operating system. And if it's nothing else, Windows 8 is integrated.

Windows 8 is quite the social butterfly. Not only can it shmooze with the best of them, it actually may be the best. If you're looking for an integrated social experience, Windows 8 comes very close to having it all. Unlike iOS, which requires you to dive into apps as if they were buckets of specific information, Windows 8 is broad and expansive. Start screen tiles are natively integrated with your apps; it is impossible to decouple them, and I can't see a reason for why would you want to.

Microsoft

Tiles surface information as it comes in, not unlike peering through a window. See what Microsoft did there? So the Mail app previews recent e-mails; the Calendar app shows your next appointment. You can also set this information to surface on your lock screen, although the version of the beta I tested could only surface detailed previews from the Calendar.

Contacts from multiple sources are integrated, too, in the People app. When it recognizes the same contact from different networks, it merges them. I found most merged without fail, although there were some oddities. Physical addresses appear with a link to Bing Maps for quick lookups, and accounts that are added to one app--such as People--cross over to other related apps, like Messaging.

Search is global, and includes data from all your apps that have activated the search hooks. Of course, this being Windows, you can easily tweak those settings.

Although the Windows Store wasn't open at the time this First Take was written, Microsoft has said that Windows 8 will sync apps through the Store. There's also a Live SDK that developers can use to hook into the single sign-on, and the aforementioned SkyDrive for file sync. So as your apps are integrated with each other and Windows 8 as a whole, they are also syncable. Use your Microsoft log-in on any Windows 8 computer, and instantly your apps, settings, files, and browser history will get pulled down.

The beta of Internet Explorer 10 continues on the path dictated by IE 9. IE 9 and 10 are the most standards-compliant versions of Internet Explorer yet, as well as recognized by several sources as extremely good at blocking malware and phishing.

There's also stuff you're likely to never encounter that's protecting you, like Trusted Boot for double-checking system integrity and SmartScreen to protect you from phishing and malware. There are features like XBox Game and XBox Companion apps for pulling XBox content into Windows 8; a new Refresh option that will re-install Windows 8 without deleting your data; and multiple monitor support for showing Start on one screen and the desktop on the other.

Some people may find it jarring that most of the Windows utilities appear in the Windows 8 desktop screen, even when you launch them from the Start screen. Still, Microsoft has made some effort to make them more accessible. The Task Manager, for example, has been redecorated with colors, charts, and tabs.

Microsoft

As far as default features are concerned, though, Windows 8 beta presents a solid baseline of apps and functionality to get you started. Don't be surprised if hardware manufacturers are allowed to insert their own preferred apps by the time that Windows 8 ships in the second half of this year.

Performance

One important aspect of Windows 8 that I haven't gone in-depth on yet is that it feels quick. You swipe and you're there. Tap and you're there. Mousing around feels just as zippy, and there's a speed and responsiveness to Windows 8 that no other version of Windows has ever had. If there's a third pillar supporting this massive overhaul alongside the integration and the touch interface, it's that Windows 8 zooms.

All of which is even more impressive considering that my demo hardware was a Samsung tablet designed for Windows 7. Shutdown times weren't impressive, taking around a minute. Boot up was blazing, though, taking between 10 and 13 seconds to get to the log-in screen over three cold boots. From the log-in screen to the Start screen took under 3 seconds in each of three cold boots.

Microsoft has said that Windows 8 is designed to sip on battery life. We didn't get the opportunity to benchmark precisely how accurate that claim is, but after heavy daily use for six days straight, I only had to plug in this older-model tablet once a day. It also was good about keeping a charge when unplugged and not in use, something that has not been true of many tablets currently on the market.

Microsoft

Conclusion

It would be beyond shocking if Windows 8 landed like Vista did. This is a tight consumer experience, with features both new and familiar, and in a refreshingly different package. Hardware makers are on-board, Microsoft says developers are investing heavily in it, and it's earning its buzz because there's nothing quite like it out there.

Businesses will probably eat it up, as will some early adopters and, of course, the Windows die-hards. But will it take off with the average consumer? Microsoft has ceded a lot of ground to Apple on the tablet, and even some of my colleagues at CNET are surprised when jumping from Metro to desktop screens. Perhaps most damning of all, very few people are able to understand the concept of the edges without a 10-second tutorial. It's not much, but it's enough that if it goes unaddressed, people will abandon Windows 8.

I think there's room for a third player in the tablet game, and Google has left the door open for a good fight over the No. 2 slot. But I also think that approaching Windows 8 as a larger smartphone, as many people have been doing with tablets, will lead to frustration. It's decidedly not that.

Windows 8 is an attempt to unify the desktop and the tablet. Microsoft has nailed the operating system, given that it didn't have much choice if it wanted to compete in the tablet space. Too much of Windows 8's fate resides on partnerships, though. It depends on hardware, affordability, how closely the pitch to consumers matches the reality of adoption, and, frankly, what Apple does. Ultimately, Microsoft has control over only one of those, and it's only partial control at that.

There's a long, narrow road ahead for Windows 8. It could be the next big thing, but there's not much room for missteps.",html

AUSTIN, Texas--Just one year after it initially previewed its new Internet Explorer 9 browser, Microsoft formally launched the software today at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival (SXSW), bringing in representatives from launch partners from The Huffington Post, Foursquare, Groupon, and Pandora to demonstrate an experience that looks less like the Web as we know it and more like the app ecosystem of a smartphone or tablet.

""We're used to the Web getting better because of everything other than the PC,"" Internet Explorer's Dean Hachamovitch said of how the most innovative kinds of Web development have, of late, been for mobile and tablet platforms. Thanks to higher optimization for HTML5 and the ability to take advantage of more processor power, he said that IE9, which goes live later on Monday, will ""bring all the benefits of a modern PC with Windows to browsing the Web.""

Microsoft representatives previewed the IE9-optimized version of Foursquare, the geolocation app that's been ubiquitous at SXSW this year (again) and has built ""Foursquare Playground,"" a new Web application that uses an animated HTML5 3D map that can sense the user's location, display locations with high levels of Foursquare activity, and offer a business search that can jump out into Bing Maps (which already has a notable Foursquare partnership in place).

These HTML5 sites are able to be as rich as they are because of hardware acceleration, which fuels the browser with the power of the graphics processing unit (GPU) as well as the central processing unit (CPU). They demonstrated the same HTML5 site--a graphics-intensive music archive for Seattle rock station KEXP--on both a Windows computer running IE9 and a MacBook Pro running Firefox. The Firefox browser, not surprisingly, was considerably slower in the demonstration, as was Google Chrome running on a MacBook in a later demonstration.

While Microsoft Internet Explorer still has powerful market share in the mainstream, tech industry professionals have long since abandoned its lackluster earlier versions for the likes of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. But IE9 won't be compatible with the older Microsoft XP operating system, which still runs on 40 to 50 percent of Windows PCs.

The unveiling was held at a ballroom at the W Hotel in Austin, where the walls were decorated with the logos of the brands and companies that have partnered for ""pinned"" sites--logos that look suspiciously similar to iOS app icons. Tweaking and ""pinning"" a site for IE9 can result in a 50 percent jump in user engagement, Microsoft representatives said.

Web cult hero Ze Frank, a SXSW regular, joined the IE9 team onstage to preview his new application, Star.me, which was one of the featured launch partners. He hyped up HTML5 browsers, specifically IE9, as being able to bring back the ""sense of discovery and play"" that characterized the Web in its earliest days. Star.me, he said, is ""like a social game meets a social network where you're kind of in kindergarten but just had a lot of espresso"" by awarding cartoon ""stars"" to other Web users' profiles.

""Bringing these kinds of experiences back into the browser as a sort of a natural place for wondrous, joyous, experiences to start popping up again is awesome,"" Frank said, ""and I think IE9 is a commitment to bringing that joy and wonder back into the browser and kind of back into the Web.""

Not exactly a hardcore productivity app, but the stars are pretty cute.",html

Google has released a fourth version of Chrome called Canary for those keen on the latest features but willing to put up with more bugs and crashes.

Chrome Canary installs alongside any of the three existing versions of Chrome--stable, beta, and developer, according to a mailing list message by Google programmer Huan Ren last week. That lets developers test different versions more easily on the same computer, although Canary is available only for Windows at present.

Perhaps more interesting to Chrome enthusiasts is that Google plans to update Canary more often than the developer release, new versions of which arrive roughly every two weeks.

""The canary usually updates more frequently than the Dev channel (higher risk of bustage), and we're working on making it update as often as we have successful nightly builds,"" said Mark Larson, ""I recommend it for anyone who wants to help test the latest Chrome features. The data we get back from canary users--especially crash statistics--helps us find and fix regressions faster.""

In other words, it's the canary in the coal mine--something that will indicate early signs of trouble.

While Chrome Canary could be updated as often as once a day, Google plans to release stable versions of Chrome more frequently as well. Stable versions have arrived roughly once a quarter, and Google wants to double that pace.

The next major version of Google's browser, Chrome 6, likely will arrive in beta form soon since developers recently froze the code base to stabilize it.

Chrome has steadily gained usage share since its first beta release in September 2008. With version 5, Chrome arrived in stable form for Mac OS X and Linux as well.

Google later this year plans to release a browser-based operating system called Chrome OS. Although it runs Linux under the hood, the applications run within the browser, one incarnation of the concept known as cloud computing.

Although Canary is installed in a separate area of a hard drive from what's already installed, it can behave similarly through Chrome's gradually expanding synchronization ability.

At present, Chrome can sync bookmarks, preferences, themes, form data, and most recently, extensions. Under development is syn for passwords and some browsing history.

The current Canary build is 6.0.472.0, the same version number as the Chrome developer build. However there are apparently some differences. For example, tab-to-search didn't work in my test on Canary.

Canary has a significant limitation besides just its availability only for Windows, though, as Chrome leader Darin Fisher asked on the mailing list: ""One question: Why can't I make this be my default browser?""

http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-20012719-93.html,Introducing the CNET News iPhone app,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"We're often so busy looking at other people's iPhone apps we don't have time to take a break for self-promotion, but this is big.

We're happy to introduce CNET News' very own iPhone app. It became available as a free download on the App Store on Tuesday, so you might have already downloaded it and begun reading CNET News articles (including this one) from it.

CNET News has long had a mobile browser friendly version of its home page, and that will still live on. But our new app brings several new features to the table like:

 Mobile-optimized search

 Personal bookmarking

 Sharing links to Twitter and Facebook

 (Nearly) full-screen reading

 A built-in Twitter feed of CNET personalities

The app makes it easy to hop to different topics of interest, just like you'd get on the full-size version of CNET News. To do so, you can just swipe your finger across the top of the screen and select the category you like, be it Webware, Crave, Microsoft, or CNET's Green Tech blog.

Screenshots by Josh Lowensohn/CNET

Longtime mobile readers will be pleased to know that articles load up in their entirety instead of piece by piece. We've also cooked up a version of our search that's both as fast and as relevant as you get on the site itself, so you can find and get to older articles with ease.

As far as bookmarking goes, articles can be saved within the app for reading later, or shared by e-mail, Facebook, and Twitter. When sharing to one of these latter two social networks, we've worked it out so you can share without interrupting your reading. The same goes for following CNET editors on Twitter, which you can do right from the news stream.

The app is completely free (get it here) and has many additional features in the pipeline. Be sure to give us your feedback, which you can do by hitting the feedback button in the app's ""more"" section. We hope you enjoy it, and look forward to filling it up with great stories.

Update: Many of you have asked if and when the app is coming to non-U.S. and Canadian App Stores. The answer on that is yes! It will be in other markets in the next couple of days. As for an Android version, that is also a yes. It's being built right now, and should be here in a few weeks.

For CNET TV fans, we've also got an iPhone app in development, which will let you watch your favorite CNET TV programming on the go. Though it's worth noting you can do that already by heading to the CNET TV page from your mobile browser.

Please keep the feedback coming, and if you like the app, be sure to rate it in the App Store.",html

Chrome programmers have begun experimental work to endow Google's browser with a full-screen tab-management interface similar to the Panorama feature Mozilla is adding to Firefox.

As browsers have expanded to accommodate ever larger amounts of computing tasks, separating different tasks into different tabs across the top of the browser window, managing them has become more onerous. A list of five or six tabs isn't so bad, but when there are 20 or 40, it's a different story. Mozilla's Panorama, nee Tab Candy, provides a full-screen view of all a browser window's tabs, grouped how the user desires into sets.

Google

Chrome could get a comparable feature, at least on Mac OS X, called ""Tabpose."" Work on the project began in July, but it's labeled ""experimental.""

Though it has some similarities with Panorama, Tabpose developer Nico Weber said Tabpose was started before he became aware of Mozilla's project and isn't based on it. ""Tab Candy and the Chrome tab overview idea developed independently,"" Weber said.

""We don't support grouping or dragging around or closing tabs or anything like that. It works very much like Apple's Expose: Swipe your trackpad to get an overview; click to select a tab. Nothing else,"" Weber added. ""But it's an experimental feature, so all that is subject to change.""

Dealing with larger numbers of tabs is a bigger issue as people spend more and more time in the browser, said Linus Upson, Google's vice president of engineering for Chrome and Chrome OS. ""I think Mozilla is doing interesting things there,"" he said. However, he cautioned, Google tries a lot of things that don't necessarily become permanent.

""We try lots of things and experiment. We put things out in the developer channel and take them back if we don't like them.

Chrome gets 'labs' ability

It seems likely people will be able to try it relatively easily, though. Tabpose is one of the features set to be enabled by a new ""about:labs"" mechanism to enable experimental features. Google likes the ""labs"" approach to letting people try new technology, with labs projects for search, Gmail, Maps, and more.

That contrasts with today's much more user-unfriendly mechanism, launching Chrome with specific options enabled via textual command-line ""switches"" or ""flags."" Changing Chrome options by using a regular browser interface is similar to Mozilla's ""about:config"" command, which exposes many options for tweaking Firefox behavior.

But Google has a little more on its mind than just convenience, Upson said. That's because Chrome OS doesn't expose any underlying operating system to make the change.

""With Chrome OS, it's challenging when it's the whole operating system and there is no command line you can launch it from,"" Upson said.

On Windows, the ""about:labs"" mechanism also will be used to enable a feature to put tabs on the left side of the interface.

Graphics chip acceleration

After a few months of planning, Google also revealed Friday its full plan for Chrome's hardware acceleration technique. Hardware acceleration lets faster, more power-efficient hardware handle tasks such as scaling images, drawing vector graphics, processing Web page display instructions, and rendering text, and it's a big performance overhaul under way in the browser market.

Google had a trickier time implementing hardware acceleration than some rivals because Chrome isolates browser rendering chores into a separate process that for security reasons isn't permitted to talk directly to the operating system's hardware interfaces. Thus, Google needed to create a separate process with appropriate authority to enable hardware acceleration.

It's not yet clear when exactly hardware acceleration will arrive in Chrome. Many features, such as accelerated compositing of two-dimensional Canvas graphics, were just pushed back from Chrome 7 to Chrome 8. The move happened about the same time that Google began working on the development version of Chrome 7.

Updated 3:22 p.m. PDT with further Google comment and corrected at 10:52 p.m. PDT to note the independent development of Tabpose from Firefox Panorama.

Google has begun shipping a feature called False Start in its Chrome browser to speed up secure communications.

False Start essentially cuts out one set of the back-and-forth conversation needed to set up a secure channel between a Web browser and Web pages. Such secure channels use technology called SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security), and a Web site using it shows an address beginning with HTTPS rather than HTTP.

""The latest releases of Chrome now enable a feature called SSL False Start,"" said Google programmer Mike Belshe in a blog post Sunday. ""As of this writing, Chrome is the only browser implementing it.""

Belshe's tests showed it cutting off less than a tenth of a second. That may not sound like much, but bear in mind that Web developers strive to shave off any amount they can and that the security handshake often must be completed more than once for a single Web site because of multiple secured elements.

False Start is one of a handful of technologies Google is building into Chrome to try to make the Web faster. Faster encrypted communications are a particular focus, especially with the debut of the Firesheep software that can extract personal data from unsecured Web communications.

False Start is a nice technology because unlike many communication improvements, it requires an improvement to the browser but not to the other end of the line. But there's a wrinkle: some Web sites can't handle False Start, and they don't fail gracefully.

Thus, Chrome has a blacklist to disable the feature for these sites. According to the Chrome source code, that list is 5,106 sites long so far.",html

Apple's rumored iWatch could be as much of a high-end fashion accessory as a high-tech gadget.

AppleInsider got its hands on a research note from KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who is known for successful predictions on Apple products, that says two sizes of the device could be on consumers' wrists by this fall and certain models might cost upwards of several thousand dollars.

Kuo expects the reported iWatch casing and band to come in several different materials, which could mean some versions of the wearable would cost more than others. Kuo says the high-end version could be comparable to luxury watches and carry a very costly price tag.

Along with the price and launch predictions, Kuo believes the rumored iWatch will come in two sizes -- both a 1.3-inch and 1.5-inch display. The display is said to be flexible AMOLED with sapphire cover, which means the screen may be curved to mimic the shape of a user's wrist. Additionally, Kuo forecasts the wearable to carry a 200 to 250mAh cell battery that should power it for at least one day, which is longer than average for many smartwatches.

Samsung, Sony , ZTE , and other tech players have already unveiled their own smartwatches, so Apple is already fashionably late to this party. But the iPhone-maker could shake up the smartwatch market with a device that is different in both performance and design from its rival products.

Rumors about the purported iWatch have been flying over the past few months. Beyond having the reported ability to sync with iPhones and iPads, the device is also said to be able to serve as a health and fitness tracker by tapping into an iOS 8 app called Healthbook.

On Tuesday, Taiwan's Economic Daily News also reported that the wearable could be unveiled in the third quarter of this year with Apple aiming to produce a total of 65 million iWatches.

CNET contacted Apple for comment and will update the story with any further details.

Light at the end of the tunnel for AT&T iPhone subs

Hi Maggie,



My wireless contract with Sprint is now over, and I'm looking around at which carrier to move to. Verizon is at the top of my list, but I am curious how the new iPhone might affect Verizon's quality of service.

With so many people saying they plan to move from AT&T to Verizon when the new iPhone becomes available there, what are the chances that Verizon's network will suffer the way AT&T's has? By the same token, what are the odds that AT&T's network will improve if a mass exodus of iPhone users does happen?

Thanks for your input!

Jen

Dear Jen,

It's difficult to say for sure whether Verizon will suffer from the same network problems that AT&T experienced after it launched the iPhone. Presumably, Verizon has had three years to get its network in good shape in anticipation for the heavy traffic loads from the iPhone. The company has also been selling Google Android phones for more than a year. And subscribers using these devices tend to consume data in a similar fashion as iPhone users on AT&T's network. And in some cases, Android users actually use more network resources.

So my gut feeling is that Verizon's network is in good shape. Verizon's network has held up very well to the rigors of the Android smartphones. Another advantage the company has is that it will soon be dumping more data traffic from new 4G devices onto its faster LTE network. Verizon is expected to announce a bunch of 4G handsets at CES in January.

As for AT&T, it will be interesting to see what happens once the iPhone is offered on another provider, such as Verizon. Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said in a research note earlier this week that the bulk of Verizon iPhone subscribers will likely come from AT&T. AT&T's network was recently voted the worst in the U.S. in terms of customer satisfaction in a Consumer Reports survey.

If there is a mass exodus from AT&T to Verizon for the iPhone, this would be very bad news for AT&T. But it could also be good news for AT&T iPhone customers who don't jump ship for Verizon. If enough people leave the network and go somewhere else, it will alleviate congestion on the network.

Even if that doesn't happen, AT&T has made significant strides in the last year and a half upgrading its network. It's added more network backhaul in high-volume areas such as New York City and San Francisco. It's switched over to the 850MHz spectrum for 3G service, in some places which should help alleviate congestion. Previously, most of its 3G service was on 1900MHz spectrum.

I guess the short answer to your question is that hopefully iPhone users all around, whether they subscribe to Verizon or AT&T, will get better service than many have experienced so far strictly on AT&T's network.

Of course, some of the issues that iPhone users encounter may be problems with the Apple hardware and software and not problems associated with AT&T's network. But that's a topic for another question.

Sharing Amazon Kindle e-books

Dear Maggie,



I am thinking about getting an Amazon Kindle for both my husband myself for Christmas. But before I decide on getting us each a Kindle, I want to make sure that if I buy a book we can each download it onto our individual readers for one purchase price (as you would a real book).

Thank you...all the information has been extremely helpful.

Barbara

Dear Barbara,

As long as you and your husband are on the same Amazon account using the same credit card, you will be able to share all books that you download onto your Kindle. In fact, you can have up to six Kindles registered to the same account. So if you have children, you could buy them Kindles, and the entire family will be able to share e-books.

One thing to keep in mind is that Amazon Kindle books use DRM protection or digitial rights management software, which means you can only download the book a set number of rimes. It's similar to how iTunes works. Once this limit is reached for each book, you can't download it anymore without repurchasing it. Typically, books can be downloaded five or six times before it can no longer be downloaded.

Sharing your Kindle books with people not on the same account is a little trickier, unless you are willing to add people to your account. Amazon just introduced a new capability that allows you to share a book once with another Kindle user for a period of 14 days. Sharing the Amazon e-books works with Kindle device as well as Kindle apps on devices, such as the iPad and iPhone. And when the book is being borrowed by a friend, you cannot access it.

One big catch is that not all of Amazon's 720,000 e-books will be lendable. Each book publisher decides if they will allow this practice. The Kindle competitor Barnes & Noble's Nook also allows a similar sharing feature.

There are ways to get around the sharing barrier and allow friends to keep the Amazon Kindle e-book longer than 14 days. The way you can do it is that you can de-register your Amazon Kindle from your own account and reregister it on a friend's account. Then you can download the book you want onto your Kindle. And voila! You've got a book from your friend's collection.

Once you've downloaded the book, you can de-register your Kindle from your friend's account and register it again with your own account.

If you do this, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. First, if you allow someone to use your account, that person can purchase items on that account using the registered credit card. Also, once you reauthorize your own account, the book you downloaded from your friend will be on your Kindle, but it will not appear in your list of purchased books in your Amazon account. This means that if you erase it from your Kindle, you can't download it again from your account. You'd have to go through the process you just went through to get the book back.

Skype Mobile and Wi-Fi?

Dear Maggie,



Do you have any idea if Verizon Wireless will lift the restriction that you cannot use Skype over Wi-Fi on its wireless network?

Thanks,

Chris

Dear Chris,

The Verizon Wireless Skype application, which is now available on more than 20 handsets from LG, Motorola, Samsung and RIM, only works over Verizon's cellular voice network. It's designed differently than the Skype Mobile application that users can download for the Apple iPhone or Google Android phones.

So with that in mind, it's unlikely that Verizon will enable Skype to operate over a Wi-Fi connection in this particular application. But that doesn't mean that you cannot use Skype over Wi-Fi on a Verizon Android phone.

In October, Skype launched a full-fledged mobile app in the Android market. This app was launched primarily for Android users overseas and for Android subscribers on other U.S. carriers other than Verizon. Overseas the application works on 3G networks and Wi-Fi. In the U.S. this app only works on Wi-Fi.

If you are a Verizon Wireless Android customer and you want Skype for Wi-Fi on your phone, you can also download this free app from the Android Market. When you want to use Skype on the cellular network you can use the Verizon Skype App and if you want to use it over Wi-Fi, you can use the other Android Market app.

It's not the ideal solution, but it works.

The benefit of using Skype over Wi-Fi is that it enables you to bypass the wireless phone network when making phone calls. For example, if you are traveling overseas you can make Skype-to-Skype calls or Skype Out calls using the Wi-Fi network. The Verizon Skype app doesn't work overseas, since you need to be on Verizon's network for it to work. Using a Wi-Fi hot spot instead of the voice network, prevents you from racking up hefty roaming charges.

But even over the cellular network there are advantages to using the Skype application. For instance, using the Verizon Skype app, you can make Skype-to-Skype calls without deducting minutes from your voice service plan. And you can still make inexpensive international Skype Out calls with rates starting around 2 cents a minute.

Hope this helps!",html

Released today, Google Chrome 17 beta for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome Frame.

Of the multiple improvements and fixes noted in Google's Chrome 17 beta changelog, these two have the potential to affect users the most. The change in security behavior expands Chrome's safe browsing technology to scan not only Web sites visited, but downloads as well. It will analyze installation files downloaded with the browser, starting with Windows-based EXE and MSI. Google hasn't clarified if the scan will also include other Windows-based file types or installers from Mac and Linux operating systems. The feature is important for blocking the threat of ransomware ""fake antivirus"" programs, among other things.

While the feature is certainly appreciated for future threats, it's still a bit like closing the barn door long after the horse has bolted for the open plains. Fake antivirus has been plaguing Windows users for years, and last year made some notable attacks against Macs.

Chrome's pending psychic powers sound similar to technology in the Kindle Fire's Silk browser. As you type in a query into Chrome 17 beta's location bar, which Google calls the ""omnibox,"" it will begin to load some pages in the background. ""If the URL auto-completes to a site you're very likely to visit, Chrome will begin to prerender the page,"" wrote Dominic Hamon, a software engineer at Google in the blog post announcing the browser update.

Microsoft issued four security bulletins on Tuesday to fix five holes in Windows and Office, including a critical vulnerability in a Windows Help and Support Center feature that has been targeted by attacks.

The vulnerability in the online help feature, which is delivered with supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, could allow an attacker to take control of a computer by luring a computer user to a malicious Web site. The bulletin has a severity rating of ""critical"" for Windows XP and ""low"" for Windows Server 2003, according to the advisory.

Microsoft and others criticized Google researcher Tavis Ormandy for publicly disclosing the hole before the software giant had a chance to develop a fix and releasing a proof-of-concept exploit. Ormandy defended his actions, saying he needed to get Microsoft's attention to fix the problem, and other researchers supported him. Within days of the disclosure, there were attacks discovered that exploited the hole.

""Of the zero-day vulnerabilities patched today, we're only seeing one be exploited in the wild,"" said Joshua Talbot, security intelligence manager at Symantec Security Response. ""In just the few weeks since the Help and Support Center issue came to light, three public exploits have surfaced, all using different attack mechanisms. We saw attack activity begin increasing on June 21, but it's since leveled out.""

Microsoft's Patch Tuesday releases also include two critical security bulletins fixing a vulnerability in the Canonical Display Driver and two vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Access ActiveX Controls, both of which could allow an attacker to take control of a computer. The canonical display driver bulletin is rated ""critical"" for the 64-bit version of Windows 7 and ""important"" for Windows Server 2008 R2 with Windows Aero enabled. The Access ActiveX Controls bulletin is rated ""critical"" for Office 2003 and 2007.

In addition, Microsoft released a bulletin rated ""important"" that resolves a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Office Outlook 2002, 2003, and 2007.

Microsoft is also ending support for Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows 2000 on Tuesday, Jerry Bryant group manager for Microsoft's Response Communications, wrote in a blog post.

""Since Windows XP is still the most popular OS version for Windows, I believe we're dealing with hundreds of millions of Windows XP SP2 systems that need to be upgraded,"" said Wolfgang Kandek, chief technology officer at Qualys. ""Our own monitoring shows that roughly 50 percent of all XP machines still run on the SP2 version.""

""I was disappointed to see that a number of privately reported flaws were not patched in this final update to Windows XP SP2,"" said H.D.Moore, chief security officer at Rapid7. ""This effectively leaves XP SP2 unprotected against a number of serious vulnerabilities that will be fixed for SP3 later this year. One of these is an issue I reported to Microsoft in December of 2006, which has a serious impact on most rich-text aware applications.""

Still pending is a fix for a new Windows flaw that could compromise the security of machines running Windows XP and 2000 that was disclosed by Secunia last week.

SAN FRANCISCO--By many estimates, texting while driving is unsafe, which explains why 30 states currently have laws on the books restricting the act. And yet data suggests that those laws do nothing to actually prevent users from testing while driving.

That's where Vlingo comes in. The service is aiming to keep users' hands on the wheel and eyes on the road with its new InCar feature for Android. The functionality, which will be available exclusively on Sprint handsets through the end of the year, adds a read-back feature for texts messages. So now you can not only speak texts through Vlingo, but it will also read the replies out loud.

In addition, Vlingo has integrated Google Maps so that you can get directions without ever having to touch or look at your phone. The service has also thrown in an extra feature, dubbed Vlingo Answers, that lets you speak a question (such as ""what is a good French wine?"") and then receive an answer back aloud. (During the demo, it was pretty amusing to hear the app try to pronounce French words, but it did an admirable job.)

Since this is an audio-only feature, the image here doesn't do it a lot of justice. Luckily, Vlingo has posted a video that nicely-illustrates the InCar functionality. Check it out below.",html

Facebook has been blocking a tool intended to let people extract contact information their friends have shared with them, the tool's developer said today--but he's working on a way to evade Facebook's restrictions.

""Facebook is trying so hard to not allow you to export your friends. They started to remove e-mails of your friends from your profile by today July 5th 2011. It will no longer work for many people,"" warned Mohamed Mansour, developer of the Facebook Friend Exporter, a Chrome extension that automates the data extraction process.

The tool lets people save their contacts' e-mail addresses, birthdays, phone numbers, and other information into a text file or to directly import them into Gmail. That makes it much easier for Google account holders to rebuild their contact network at Google+, Google's brand-new social network site.

The activity surrounding the export tool spotlights the value of the data contained in social networks. Google believes people should be able to extract information about their contacts and provides tools to let people do so. Facebook, the incumbent power in social networking, provides only a tool to let people extract what they themselves have put into the network. The friend list it provides is a series of names in plain text--no contact information, and not even a link to their Facebook pages to help distinguish John Smith No. 1 from John Smith No. 2.

Facebook's actions to block the extension apparently were effective. Many users of the Facebook Friend Exporter tool reported that it didn't work, producing only names and the address of their Facebook pages, but not the e-mail address. In addition, Facebook earlier had begun showing addresses as graphics, not text that was easily detected, processed, and copied; Mansour got around this obstacle by extracting the information through the mobile version of Facebook's site.

In a comment on his Google+ page, Mansour had this to say:

This is what happens when your extension becomes famous :sigh: Facebook just removed the emails from their mobile site. They implemented a throttling mechanism that if you visit your ~5 friends in a short period of time, it will remove the email field. No worries, a new version is on the making ... I am bloody annoyed now, because this proves Facebook owns every users data on Facebook. You don't own anything! If I were you, I would riot this to the media outlets again. Seriously ... more motivation to figure out a different approach.

It's become a cat-and-mouse game. Mansour is working to sidestep Facebook's obstacles.

""New version with a different design is currently deploying,"" Mansour said. ""You might have to do exports daily. It uses a different approach, and I will maintain this version. Just bear with me.""

Mansour said that for now, he reverted his tool back to an earlier method involving iFrames.

Facebook didn't respond to request for comment yesterday and didn't immediately respond today.

The tool, though, doesn't look like a good fit with Section 3.2 of Facebook's terms of service, which state, ""You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access Facebook, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our permission.""

End runs around Facebook

Mansour isn't the only one working on a way to let people extract this data.

Rafael Laguna, chief executive of e-mail and collaboration software maker Open-Xchange, said in a Google+ post today that his company is working on a similar tool.

""If it works we will release it on our test server immediately,"" Laguna said. The work is part of the company's SocialOX project that, among other things, is designed to give people centralized control over personal information stored at sites such as Facebook, Xing, and LinkedIn.

Laguna acknowledges that it might be difficult, but believes the fact that the software is installed in many places will hamper blocking efforts.

""Using the FB API's don't get you the email address of your Friends, just name and picture which doesn't really get you far. So we have to ""scrape"" the email address from the profile page of the mobile app, like Mohamed does. Facebook may block the server but everybody can download their own Open-Xchange server and install it someplace else, this will be hard to impossible to block. In theory they can [block data availability by detecting behavior indicating an effort to copy it]. If you extend the cat-and-mouse hunt to hundreds of machines on hundreds of different lines it is very hard to track due to timing differences. Of course browsing through all friends is an unusual behavior, so you can block after a certain number of profile page views of one user. Or they can simply hide the email address behind a Captcha [the text-recognition tests used to screen out computers].

Facebook's stance has triggered something of a backlash among those who don't like to see data that's been shared to them be locked up.

A Quit Facebook Day drew a commitment, at least an ostensible one, from tens of thousands of people to dump their accounts.

And an open-source project called Diaspora has been working on social-networking software that runs on a distributed network of servers that could perhaps eventually become part of the federated social Web.. (A Diaspora feature, aspects, sounds awfully similar to Google+ circles: ""personal lists that let you group people according to the roles they play in your life [and] a simple, straightforward, lightweight way to make it really clear who is receiving your posts and who you are receiving posts from."") Diaspora is in alpha testing now, with the first invitations sent last November.

Such initiatives, though, have shown no signs of denting Facebook's dominance.

Google is another matter. It's already got millions of Gmail users and several other online services people sign up for--Google Docs, YouTube, Picasa Web Albums, for example. It's got a strong brand name and lots of spare money to fund its ambitions. It's got a mature advertising technology to make money from it. And it's got plenty of experienced programmers and a massive global network of data centers to operate at large scale.

What Google doesn't have is people using its services the way they use Facebook--a digital version of the minutae of life's interactions woven into hundreds of millions of people's daily lives. The hassle of rebuilding a person's social connections at Google+ is a major barrier to Google achieving that success.

If they get their way, your every online step would be not only irrevocable, but traceable back to you. Fortunately, there are some positive steps you can take to reclaim your online history for yourself.

The online privacy software company Abine, which makes Do Not Track Plus, also offers a service called DeleteMe, which removes your data from numerous tracking sites and keeps it from coming back. In an unusual gesture, though, they've made public how to do for yourself everything that DeleteMe does. Here's my take on their advice.

Be warned, though. The following are not easy instructions, and it's not because they're technically complex. They require a tenacity and wherewithal that is likely to either exhaust you, drive you borderline bonkers, or both. (And no, I haven't followed the instructions to remove myself because it's essential to my job that I can be found by strangers.)

Step 1: Prepare yourself: You're going to have to be polite. These instructions require patience for the antics of others and determination to get the job done. It's not a bad idea to get something inanimate to take your frustrations out on, because often getting your data successfully removed or changed will require the good faith of the person you're dealing with. Things are not likely to go your way the first time around.

Step 2: Aggressively track sites that aggressively track you. This is where the DeleteMe service comes in. They currently charge you $99 to un-track you from the tracking data clearinghouses, which in turn sell your data to others entities. You can follow Abine's list of services and do the deed yourself, and that means writing many e-mails, sending numerous faxes, and placing enough phone calls to make you wish for a time machine so you can go back to the 19th century to do violence unto Alexander Graham Bell.

One thing that isn't clear from Abine's list is that most of these data aggregators will re-add you within a few months, so I recommend at least bi-annual checks to see if they've sucked up your data again. Be tenacious, be polite, and if this is important to you, stick with it until you get what you want.

If you're concerned about privacy and people making connections between your birthday, your address, and your Social Security number, you owe it to yourself to perform at least one Web search for your name and see what comes up. You might be unpleasantly surprised.

Step 3: To protect your reputation, removal must be done from the source. To get Google, Bing, and other search engines to notice a change in information as it is presented on the Web, the original site hosting that information must change. It doesn't matter which site is the source. It could be Facebook, or a local blog, or a gaming forum. If it's showing up in search results, it has little to do with the search engine and everything to do with the site of origin. Once that site has changed, then you'll see a change in the search results.

Getting something removed from a site is not a scientific process, even though you must be methodical about it. Ask politely, and as I noted above, you're likely to have to ask more than once and using more than one way to communicate. You likely will have to be a rake at the gates of Hell, but one that uses words like ""please"" and ""thank you"".

Look for the name of a writer, or Web site manager, and if no contact information is listed, do a WhoIs search by typing ""whois www.site-name.com"". Be sure to include the quotes. That will tell you who registered the site, which is a good place to start on smaller Web sites. Look for phone numbers, e-mail, and fax numbers, and follow up your initial communication.

Once you have a name, even if you can't find a phone number or e-mail, you can probably take an educated stab at one. Use a site like E-mail Format to help you out. And in your e-mail, be sure to explain clearly, concisely, and logically why your request ought to be honored.

A willingness to compromise can get you better results, too. If, for example, your initial request to fully remove your name gets refused, see if asking to have your identity anonymized will work. And if one person at the site you've contacted keeps stalling you, see if there's another you can contact instead.

Step 4: Get Google to hustle on search engine changes. If you've been successful in changing a site, but Google is still showing the older version, you can use Google's URL Removal Tool to accelerate the process. Note that this will require a Google account, and that if you get Google to change, you're going to have to submit requests to other major search engines like Bing separately.

Step 5: Paint over the bad with good. In cases where you can't get the site to remove the content that's negatively affecting your reputation, you can create new, fresh, positive content to counteract it. The idea is that the Positive You will bury the Negative You. Rick Santorum is a great example of how this can work in reverse, and no, I'm not going to link to it for you.

You can also use social-networking sites to bury bad news. From About.Me to Flickr to Twitter, social networks tend to rank highly in search results. By creating and maintaining accounts that use your real name, you can elevate the social networking results for your name and, ideally, drop the results you want to bury onto the second page of results. Since studies show that second-page results are viewed significantly less often than first-page, this could be a successful burying strategy.

However, a key component of this is linking the networks, so be prepared to do far more social networking than you had been.

Step 6: Go (politely) nuclear. Get a lawyer. If you suspect something is actually defamatory, seek out legal advice. Gather your evidence, be polite and firm, and seek out someone who can guide you through the thorny legal thicket. This will also depend on your country -- England has much broader defamation and libel laws than the United States does -- and your budget.

My colleague Declan McCullagh noted a potential complication in hiring a lawyer: SLAPP laws. Although they vary from state to state, they all basically aim to prevent unsubstantiated legal threats. If you threaten someone, that person can turn around and sue you for attorneys fees and damages.

The bottom line: There is no foolproof method for changing how you're presented on the Internet, whether looking at purely personally-identifiable data or the much more subjective presentation of your personal reputation. However, if these are concerns of yours, you're not alone out there, and these six steps will give you concrete actions you can take to reclaim your identity and repair how others see you.",html

SAN FRANCISCO--Google announced its first commercial Chromebook laptops Wednesday at its annual Google I/O conference here.

Samsung and Acer will each be offering Chromebook laptops starting June 15. The Samsung Chromebook will cost $429 for the Wi-Fi only version and $499 for the 3G version. Acer's Wi-Fi only Chromebook will cost $349.

The devices will be available for sale in the U.S. from Amazon and Best Buy. Google will also be selling these Chromebooks internationally in the U.K., France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, and Italy.

Specs for both machines are available here.

Samsung is hosting an event later tonight where it will provide more details on the new Chromebook. Acer will also be providing details about its Chromebook.

Now Playing: Watch this: Google announces Chromebooks

Some of the benefits of the Chromebooks are that they have all-day battery life and built-in Net connectivity. With Verizon Wireless, the Chromebooks will offer pay-as-you-go pricing, with monthly or daily passes for 3G connectivity.

The Chromebooks get updates every few weeks, just like Chrome. Users don't have to worry about installing patches. The new devices have dual-core processors from Intel.

Google also announced enterprise pricing: Businesses can get Chromebooks, a Web console for management, support, warranty, replacements if something breaks, and hardware auto-updates for $28 per user per month.

And Google will be offering schools a special price on Chromebooks. It will charge $20 a month per user, including hardware, administrative support, hardware upgrades, and warranty.

Michael Gartnenberg, an analyst with Gartner, said the fact that the browser is limited to Chrome might be a factor, considering that competing products offer more capability and flexibility at roughly comparable pricing.

""It's pretty interesting,"" he said. ""But at these prices, will consumers buy it? At $499, that gets you a pretty capable Netbook or even an iPad.""

Google will offer all attendees at Google I/O free Chromebooks to test.

Sothink Web Video Downloader 4.0 and all versions of Master Filer were found to contain Trojan horse code aimed at Windows users.

In a blog post, Mozilla stated that the Master Filer add-on was able to bypass AMO's security tests.

Mozilla user CatThief discovered the threat, it said. And when Mozilla added two more security checks to its vetting process and rescanned its entire catalog, it discovered that version 4 of the Sothink Web Video Downloader also contained a Trojan horse program. Sothink Web Video Downloader contained Win32.LdPinch.gen, and Master Filer contained Win32.Bifrose.32.Bifrose.

Master Filer was removed from Mozilla's Firefox add-on site on January 25, and the Sothink video downloader was removed on Tuesday. CNET Download.com ceased hosting the Sothink add-on on Friday before noon.

Sothink Web Video Download 5.5.90819 had been a mildly popular Firefox add-on at Download.com, receiving 697 downloads in the past week and 63,716 downloads since it was first added to the site in June 2007.

Because the Trojan horse programs are tied to Firefox, Mozilla warns, host computers won't be infected until Firefox started. Uninstalling either add-on is only part of the solution, if the infection has already attacked the host computer. Mozilla recommends that users who suspect that they are infected use one of the following security applications to sweep and clean their computers after uninstalling the threatening add-on:

https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-go-back-to-ios-8-from-ios-9-beta/,How to go back to iOS 8 from iOS 9 beta,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Now Playing: Watch this: How to get back to iOS 8 from the iOS 9 beta

Reverting from the iOS 9 public beta to a more reliable version of iOS, currently iOS 8.4, is possible. While not the easiest process, if you go into it with a bit of patience and time set aside, you'll be back up and running in no time.

In order to downgrade from iOS 9 public preview, you'll need the following things:

A computer running the latest version of iTunes (12.2.1 or above).

An internet connection.

A cable to connect your iDevice to the computer.

About an hour of time set aside.

Assuming you followed Apple's suggestion of creating an iTunes backup before you installed iOS 9, you'll want to use the same computer to downgrade to iOS 8.4.

It's important to note, you will not be able to restore to an iCloud or iTunes backup created when the device was running iOS 9 to a device running iOS 8. With that in mind, make sure you have anything you don't want to lose such as pictures or messages off the device before you downgrade.

Now, let's begin the restoration process.

Enlarge Image Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET

Disable Find My iPhone on your iOS device. You can do so in the Settings app, under iCloud and Find My iPhone. Open iTunes on the computer. Connect your iOS device to the computer with the cable. Once connected, press the power and the home button for roughly ten seconds. As soon as you see the Apple logo appear on the screen of your device, let go of the power button and keep pressing the home button. A few seconds later iTunes should alert you that it has detected an iOS device in recovery mode. Click on Restore device.

Next iTunes will walk you through the process of loading iOS 8.4 on your device. You'll be asked to accept the iOS terms and services.

iTunes will then begin downloading the current, official, version of iOS 8. Depending on your download speed, this is potentially the longest part of the process. Leave the device connected to iTunes while iOS 8 is downloaded.

After the download is finished, iTunes will begin to install iOS 8. Your device may reboot a few times during this process, and any progress bars on the screen may appear stuck at times. Just trust that iTunes is working away and leave your device connected until it's finished.

Once it's finished, you'll receive an alert from iTunes asking if you'd like to set your iOS device up as brand new, or restore from the back up you created during the iOS 9 installation process. Restore the device to your last backup using iTunes, and wait until it's complete before disconnecting your device.

When the restore process is finished, you will find all of the settings, messages, photos and apps in place just like it had been before the upgrade.",html

After a premature release earlier in the day, Andy Rubin, Google's vice president of engineering in charge of Android, published the video officially on a blog post. Here's what he had to say about Android 3.0:

Honeycomb is the next version of the Android platform, designed from the ground up for devices with larger screen sizes, particularly tablets. We've spent a lot of time refining the user experience in Honeycomb, and we've developed a brand-new, truly virtual and holographic user interface. Many of Android's existing features will really shine on Honeycomb: refined multitasking, elegant notifications, access to over 100,000 apps on Android Market, home screen customization with a new 3D experience, and redesigned widgets that are richer and more interactive. We've also made some powerful upgrades to the Web browser, including tabbed browsing, form auto-fill, syncing with your Google Chrome bookmarks, and incognito mode for private browsing.

The video showed earlier in the day on Google's YouTube page for Android, Boy Genius Report said, but it vanished. Copies sprang up at Engadget and AndroidPolice, though.

The video shows a very different look than what you'll see on an Android phone.

Engadget

The interface is still Android, for example showing widgets and app icons and multiple home screens. But the widgets are often larger and more elaborate, as you might expect for an OS that, as the video asserts, is ""built entirely for tablet.""

Also shown in the video are a new wall-of-video look for browsing YouTube, a tablet-optimized Gmail app, full-screen Gmail video chat, the new 3D Google Maps interface, an e-book application for Google e-books, and ""best-in-class Web browsing,"" including multiple tabs in a very Chrome-like interface.

Missing from at least some of the shots is Android's ubiquitous notification bar. It's not clear whether it can be hidden or if the video just doesn't show it.

Honeycomb's tablet focus was expected since September, when W.P. Wong, head of Samsung Mobile's product-planning team, said Honeycomb ""is specifically optimized for a different type of tablet. This emphasizes mobility,"" during the launch of the company's Android-powered Galaxy Tab.

Android has the potential to challenge Apple's iPad, with the Samsung tablet so far the leading contender and many more challenges expected to show at CES this week. But the iPad already has a major market lead, a famously polished interface, and a wealth of tablet-optimized applications.

But it's not often that a super-secret prototype of a not-yet-released iPhone is carelessly left on the floor of a local drinking establishment.

But apparently that's what happened, according to two different gadget blogs. That this would happen to a company like Apple, which takes secrecy and security of its products very seriously, is surprising. Apple has not yet said there even is an iPhone 4G--although it's a safe bet there will be based on the pattern of the past three years. Steve Jobs has said that new iPhone software is coming ""this summer,"" but the company has stopped short of acknowledging that new hardware is in the works.

Screenshot by Erica Ogg/CNET

Normally the first time we see a new Apple product it is in Jobs' hands while standing on a stage in front of an audience of geeks and journalists. So what happened this time?

To back up: Over the weekend, Engadget posted photos of what it said might be the iPhone 4G, or the next-generation version of Apple's phone. It said it was found on the floor of a bar in San Jose, Calif., and a tipster sent the photos into the gadget blog for posting. The pictures are sort of blurry and the device is never shown powered up, so it didn't seem that hard to dismiss as yet another fake iPhone knockoff.

Flash forward to Monday morning. Engadget's rival blog, Gizmodo, ups the ante with its own photos and video of what appears to be the same device, though it claims it's from ""someone"" who found it on the floor of a bar in Redwood City, Calif. How Gizmodo got its hands on it is unclear.

There have been several suggestions that Gizmodo's parent company, Gawker Media, bought it. A tweet from Gawker boss Nick Denton on Monday appeared to confirm Gawker's willingness to pay for stories, though Gizmodo hasn't yet responded to a request for comment. The company generated much publicity when Gizmodo's sister blog Valleywag announced a bounty on early access to an iPad. Denton has also considered paying for paparazzi-style photographs of sports stars for its sports blog Deadspin. It's not impossible that the company saw Engadget's pics and tracked down the person who sent it in and paid him or her for it.

Blogger John Gruber at DaringFireball.net says that, according to his contacts at Apple, the purported iPhone 4G is considered ""stolen"" by Apple.

Apple has not responded to a request for comment.

Assuming both Engadget and Gizmodo discovered the same device, there are some odd inconsistencies in the stories, such as the discrepancy between being lost at a bar in San Jose and Redwood City, as well as claims of seeing the device powered on, but not showing photos of it. Also, Gizmodo says it took the thing apart, yet it didn't post photos of the processor or the storage.

But more importantly, how did this happen? For a company for whom secrecy is sacrosanct--consider the stories about the iPad prototypes that were bolted to tables for developers to work on and hidden under cloths--something so careless as to leave one of the most anticipated consumer devices in a public place seems incredibly out of character.

Apple does give test versions of devices to employees to take home. And every once in a while there's a report of seeing one in the wild. In this case, however, the device was housed in a protective case that would make it look to a casual observer like an iPhone 3GS. That could have been a measure to try to blend in a little better and prevent another incident like what occurred with the first iPhone, when multiple reports of employees seen using iPhones in public in Silicon Valley hit the Web.

But the difference between the original iPhone being spotted in the wild and this purported iPhone 4G being left at a bar is that Apple had already announced the iPhone in January at MacWorld. So employees testing out the hardware weren't stealing any thunder from Steve Jobs introducing the world to his latest creation. In fact, it could be seen as a ploy to drum up even more interest from consumers. Losing a working prototype of an iPhone that has not been acknowledged by Apple to exist is, well, strange.

Of course this could be chalked up to carelessness, but there's something else entirely possible: it was done on purpose.

First, Apple has been known to give incorrect information to different employees or third-party partners to identify who leaked the information if it did wind up posted on a gadget blog later.

But the second possibility is that Apple leaked this to gauge consumer reaction. The company doesn't do official focus groups. So this would be a pretty efficient, though unofficial, way to poll the entire Internet on the new features and new design choices in this prototype. You can see reactions already popping up everywhere. But as opposed to leaking photos, leaking hardware for Apple would be pretty rare, if not unprecedented. (Update 2:10 p.m. PT: Gruber posted a tweet that says he's convinced it's not a purposeful Apple leak and if it was, would not go through Gizmodo.)

In any case, it seems like more than a coincidence that both Engadget and Gizmodo ended up with ""proof"" of the iPhone 4G within a day or two of each other. Plus, when Apple actually does feel threatened by a publication posting pictures or images of an Apple device that has not yet been announced, the company isn't shy about issuing a cease and desist.

Updated at 6:10 p.m. PDT: Gizmodo posted a story about the Apple engineer, reportedly named Gray Powell, who lost the iPhone. Short version: Powell left it in a German bar in Redwood City, Calif., a month ago, and it was picked up by an unnamed person who was sitting next to him. This person then gave it to Gizmodo.

This answers some but not all questions. Things we still don't know: how did Gizmodo get it? Where does Engadget come in? How much did Gawker pay for it? And the story says Gizmodo plans to give it back to Apple, but it's not clear yet whether it has.",html

Mozilla had hoped to release Firefox 4 in 2010, but a newly updated Firefox 4 schedule shows the first release candidate arriving in early 2011.

""Development on Firefox 4 has not slowed down, and strong progress is being made daily. However, based on the delays in completing the 'feature complete' Beta 7 milestone against which our add-on developers and third-party software developers can develop, as well as considering the amount of work remaining to prepare Firefox 4 for final release, we have revised our beta and release candidate schedule,"" said Mike Beltzner, vice president of engineering for Firefox, in a mailing list message yesterday. ""The frequent beta releases have been extremely helpful in identifying compatibility issues with existing web content, so we plan on continuing to release beta milestones through the end of December. Our estimate is now that release candidate builds will ship in early 2011, with a final release date close behind.""

Six beta versions have arrived in recent weeks, but Firefox 4 beta 7 hasn't appeared, despite more than six weeks of frenzied development. One big issue holding up release has been the integration of Firefox's older Tracemonkey engine for running Web-based JavaScript programs and the new JaegerMonkey engine that draws on Google's V8 engine in Chrome.

Mozilla's arewefastyet.com site shows progress matching Safari and Chrome JavaScript execution speed, but new JavaScript engines can be tough to tune. Several JavaScript bugs are blocking Firefox 4 beta 7.

Mozilla

Among other changes in Firefox 4 are a revamped interface, a Bing search option, hardware-accelerated graphics, the new Jetpack foundation for add-ons to customize the browser, an HTML5 parser to interpret Web pages with the new standard for creating them, and WebGL for 3D Web graphics.

And presenting a major new front in the browser wars, Firefox 4 also works on Google's Android operating system for phones and other mobile devices. Today, the cutting edge in that market is dominated by the WebKit engine used on Android, Apple's iOS, and several other mobile operating systems.

Releasing the new version is important for Mozilla. Firefox remains the second most popular browser as measured by Net Applications usage statistics, but the browser market hasn't been as competitive as it is now in more than a decade.

Firefox and Opera kept the independent-browser fires burning during the years when Microsoft's Internet Explorer was dominant but somewhat dormant after its victory in the first browser wars of the 1990s.

Net Applications

Web technologies started picking up steam again, with Apple's Safari engineers joining the development effort begun by Opera and Firefox, and Firefox started wrenching significant share away from IE. But in the last two years, Google Chrome burst onto the scene, rising rapidly to third place and flattening Firefox's growth.

And even more recently, Microsoft began fighting back again with IE9, currently released in a first beta version. This browser was developed more in the open, letting outside developers get more of a say in its workings, and features many new modern abilities. Perhaps chief among them is ambitious hardware acceleration.

Firefox 4 has hardware acceleration, too, and unlike IE9 offers it for Mac OS X, Linux, and most important the vast number of Windows XP systems still in use.",html

The digital content is exclusive to iTunes, a representative of The Beatles' record company, EMI, told CNET. The exact length of that deal is unknown, but it will expire some time next year.

As of now, the iconic band's entire catalog can be purchased in Apple's iTunes Store. Each album comes with iTunes LP, which features additional content including lyrics, photos, and album art. A digital version of the Fab Four's entire body of work is also available for download for $149, and that comes with exclusive access to a video of the band's first U.S. concert, ""Live at the Washington Coliseum, 1964."" Single albums are priced at $12.99, double albums at $19.99. Songs will cost $1.29 each.

This is a personal victory for Apple CEO Steve Jobs, as The Beatles were one of the most prominent holdouts from his online music empire. Apple had tried for years to acquire rights to The Beatles' catalog.

""We love the Beatles and are honored and thrilled to welcome them to iTunes,"" said Jobs in a press release today. ""It has been a long and winding road to get here. Thanks to the Beatles and EMI, we are now realizing a dream we've had since we launched iTunes ten years ago.""

Apple hyped up the announcement over the last 24 hours with a splash page on its Web site promising that ""tomorrow is just another day. That you'll never forget."" After several hours of tech news sites buzzing about what the company could haveup its sleeve, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple would finally announce an agreement to offer The Beatles' music.

In a press release from Apple, and EMI, each of the surviving Beatles members or a representative was quoted about the news.

Paul McCartney: ""We're really excited to bring the Beatles' music to iTunes. It's fantastic to see the songs we originally released on vinyl receive as much love in the digital world as they did the first time around.""

Ringo Starr: ""I am particularly glad to no longer be asked when the Beatles are coming to iTunes. At last, if you want it--you can get it now--The Beatles from Liverpool to now! Peace and Love, Ringo.""

Yoko Ono Lennon: ""In the joyful spirit of Give Peace A Chance, I think it is so appropriate that we are doing this on John's 70th birthday year.""

Olivia Harrison: ""The Beatles on iTunes--Bravo!""

The release of the band's music online marks the end of a long journey for both EMI and Apple. The two battled in courtrooms for years over a trademark dispute: Apple Corps, The Beatles' record company, versus Apple Inc.

In 1991, the two updated a 10-year-old agreement regarding how each of them would be allowed to use its trademarks. Apple Inc. (at the time known as Apple Computer Inc.) paid Apple Corps $27 million and agreed not to enter the music distribution business under the Apple name and logo. Apple Corps later said that the computer maker broke that agreement by opening the iTunes Store, and sued in 2003. Apple Computer eventually emerged victorious when a U.K. judge ruled that it was not in violation of the agreement because it was selling prerecorded content, not original music under the logo.

The dispute was officially resolved in 2007, when a new deal replaced the 1991 agreement, which prohibited Apple Inc. from distributing music through physical media such as CDs and cassette tapes.

For those of us who always have phone in hand, waving it at a payment reader seems more convenient than fishing a debit or credit card out of our wallets.

Apple and Google have been making a big deal about their mobile-payment services this year. So we decided to set up the two companies' mobile payment apps -- Josh with an iPhone 6S and Cliff using a Samsung Galaxy S6 -- and head out to see how far Apple Pay and Android Pay could carry us through a regular week of purchases.

How the payment tech works

Both Apple Pay and Android Pay use NFC, or near-field communication, to talk with a payment reader. As its names suggests, NFC transmits information a very short distance -- five centimeters or so -- to a store's point-of-sale device. You can, of course, also touch your phone to the reader to complete the transaction.

The Apple Pay mobile payment service works with iOS 8.1 and later on the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S, and 6S Plus; the iPad Air 2, Mini 3 and 4, and Pro; and Apple Watch-compatible devices.

Android Pay requires Android 4.4 (KitKat) or later, and your Android device must be able to handle NFC. That shouldn't be too big of a hurdle, as most Android devices released in the past few years come equipped with NFC. The Samsung Galaxy line has included NFC since the S II, for example, and the HTC One phones have offered NFC from the start of the line. (Here's a list of NFC-enabled phones.)

Google just released Android Pay this fall, replacing Google Wallet, which Google is remaking into a Venmo-like app for sending and receiving money from other people.

Setting up Apple Pay and Android Pay

First, we set up the two payment apps by entering credit card information.

Apple Pay

Setting up Apple Pay was ridiculously easy. Josh needed to sign in to his iCloud account and move through a few screens to add a credit card. Apple Pay presented a screen that let him scan his credit card, grabbing the card number and expiration date. It also offered him the choice of entering card details by hand.

Josh entered several cards, and Apple Pay made the first one the default. To change the default, go to Settings, Transaction Defaults, Default Card. Then tap your preferred default card.

Apple Pay suggested Josh's name as it appears on his Apple account instead of how it appears on his credit card account. Be sure to check that Apple Pay is using the name as it appears on your card.

Josh hit one bump when he couldn't get Apple Pay to successfully scan his Virgin America Visa. This card uses a portrait orientation to display information -- unlike most cards, which are landscape -- so we thought that might be confusing Apple Pay. Josh contacted Virgin, which informed him that the Comenity-Capital-Bank-backed card is not part of Apple Pay yet but will be around the start of 2016. Here's a list of banks that work with Apple Pay.

Android Pay

When Cliff opened the Android Pay app, it showed a list of credit cards he'd added to his Google account over the years and asked him to confirm some details. The cards, mostly expired, were tied to the Google Play Store.

Removing expired cards wasn't straightforward. Cliff dug around Android Pay but couldn't find an obvious way. Ultimately, he went to payments.google.com, logged in, and removed the out-of-date cards there. He could, however, remove active cards through Android Pay.

He wanted to add a new card, so he tapped Add Another Card, which took him to a screen where he could capture an image of his card. He could also enter card details manually. After successfully grabbing the image, the app took him to a screen where he could adjust card details. He needed to enter the card security code, for example, and change the card address, as the screen displayed an older address.

After tying the card to the app, Android Pay told Cliff he had to turn on NFC to pay with the device.

Adding another card was easy enough: Cliff tapped the plus sign in the bottom-right corner of the screen and then tapped ""Add a credit or debit card"" to step through the process again.

As with Apple Pay, the first card Cliff added to Android Pay became his default payment card. To change the default card, select the card you want and then tap Set As Default Card. You can also drag the card to the Default Card slot at the top of the screen.

Here's a list of banks that work with Android Pay and which types of transactions they do and don't support.

Security in Apple Pay and Android Pay

No one wants to buy something in a store and then discover that their credit card information has been stolen.

As part of its security, Apple Pay requires your passcode or Touch ID to complete a transaction. Behind the scenes, Apple uses a security mechanism called tokenization, which allows the company to keep sensitive credit card information off your iOS device. With tokenization, the credit card number stays with the financial company, and Apple Pay uses a substitute account number token to represent the real card number.

If you misplace your phone, someone would have to know your passcode to use Apple Pay. And if you have turned on Find My iPhone, you can suspend Apple Pay by placing your iPhone in Lost Mode using Find My iPhone. You can also remove the ability to pay with Apple Pay by erasing the device remotely using Find My iPhone.

Android Pay also requires your phone's passcode or pattern unlocking mechanism to authenticate a payment. If you are running Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) on a phone with a fingerprint sensor, you can use fingerprint authentication to trigger a transaction.

Like Apple, Google uses tokenization for Android Pay and substitutes your credit card details with a virtual account number. And if you lose track of your device, if you have turned on Android Device Manager (ADM), you can lock or erase your Android phone on Google's ADM website.

According to security experts, tokenization raises the bar on securing mobile transactions. ""The security behind Apple Pay and Google Pay is sound,"" says Paul Ferguson, a senior threat research advisor at Trend Micro. ""The technology Apple and Google use and the NFC technologies they are based on are secure.""

Ferguson cautions, however, that users still need to be watchful. ""There is no such thing as 100 percent secure,"" he told us, recommending that users still need build up their mobile security defenses, starting with good password management.

Apple Pay and Android Pay in action

We found that Apple Pay and Android Pay work equally well and are surprisingly easy to use. Tap your phone on an NFC reader, authorize the payment, and you are done. The process is very similar to using a debit or credit card. What is also surprising is that while mobile payment readers aren't scarce, less than a third of the businesses we visited in the Bay Area over a week accepted Apple Pay or Android Pay.

Here's a list of the many local businesses (including several chains) we visited and whether they accepted mobile payments.

Walgreens not only accepts both payment methods but also was able to use Josh's Walgreens mobile rewards card stored in Apple Wallet.

Peet's coffee shop accepts Apple Pay and Android Pay.

Berkeley's Monterey Market takes both Apple and Android Pay, and a store clerk said that both are popular ways to pay.

McDonald's, to Josh's relief, accepts both payment apps.

Radio Shack had one reader and could handle Apple Pay and Android Pay.

Trader Joe's takes both Apple Pay and Android Pay. A checker said, however, few customers take advantage of them.

At the downtown San Francisco Apple Store, Josh bought the new iPad Pro using Apple Pay. To their credit, the store employees didn't laugh when Cliff asked if they accept Android Pay.

T-Mobile accepts Apple Pay, but the clerks said that the store wasn't set up to accept Android Pay yet.

Starbucks does not accept Apple Pay or Android Pay but does accept mobile payments through its Starbucks app, which you can load up via Apple Wallet.

At Solano Cellars, a Berkeley wine shop, a clerk said he had ordered an NFC reader, as many customers ask to pay with their phones.

Costco doesn't take mobile payments, but a checker said she heard her store might start early next year.

Pastime, Cliff's local hardware store, doesn't take mobile payments.

iScream, a Berkeley ice cream shop, doesn't handle either payment method. That didn't diminish how good its ice cream is.

Despite Bank of America being one of the banks that supports mobile payments, the teller at the local branch told Cliff he couldn't use the B of A debit card on his phone to withdraw money from his account.

Harvest & Rowe, a casual restaurant near our office, does not accept mobile payments.

CVS pharmacy doesn't support either mobile payment app.

Target doesn't accept either mobile app either.

The post office doesn't accept either app. But the holiday stamps this year are especially nice.

Chipotle doesn't work for either app. We've been reading about the restaurant's possible adoption of mobile payments for a year, so we were surprised to find out it doesn't yet.

At the Cerrito Theatre, the ticket seller apologized for taking only ""old-school credit cards and cash"" and didn't know of plans to start accepting mobile payments.

The Gap does not accept either app. We heard a nearby Gap was running a mobile payment trial, but when we showed up, the store just accepted cash or credit cards.

Berkeley's beloved Zachary's Chicago Pizza does not handle mobile payments for its stuffed pizza pies.

Neither does Kensington's Benchmark Pizzeria, which makes equally good but much thinner pies.

While we didn't expect the Chai Cart on Market Street to accept either payment app, we were glad we could pay via Square (Android, iOS).

Cliff didn't see an NFC reader at his local Safeway and asked if he could pay with his phone. The clerk thought he was offering to barter his Android device for his bag of groceries.

What's the payout?

We are still in the early days of mobile payments -- Apple Pay arrived a year ago and Android Pay came out this fall. A recent study shows mobile payment usage growing, but the numbers are small. With Apple Pay, for example, just 16.6 percent of iPhone 6 users have tried the payment app. Another study shows Android Pay usage is even less, at least on supported Samsung devices.

Apple Pay and Android Pay are each a snap to use. There just aren't enough places to use them. For a while at least, we will still need to carry our cards.

Today the Fire's flames are being fanned by the Silk browser, which on the front end is touted as a much faster browser using cheaper hardware because all Web activity is filtered through Amazon's cloud-based Amazon Web Services.

But that has been a hot topic in the last few weeks because, essentially, the Silk Web browser can track everything a user does on the Web and keeps a permanent record.

Now Congress is getting involved, and this has already turned into a bipartisan issue. On Friday, Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) penned and issued a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos explicitly detailing his concerns with Silk. ?Specifically, Markey is asking for Amazon to provide answers to the following questions (and likely more) by Friday, November 4: What information does Amazon plan to collect about users of the Kindle Fire?

How does Amazon intend to use this information? Does Amazon plan to sell, rent or otherwise make available this customer information to outside companies? If yes, to which firms?

How will Amazon convey its privacy policy to Fire and Silk users? Please provide Amazon's privacy policy covering the Kindle Fire, if available.

If Amazon plans to collect information about its users' Internet browsing habits, will customers be able to affirmatively opt in to participate in the data sharing program?

At least Markey didn't mince words here. These are certainly questions that likely many consumers are pondering. Items like what Amazon will do with this data and the points about customers opting in vs. auto opt-in really speak to consumer concerns these days.

Amazon has attempted to sway concerns already on its FAQ section, arguing that Silk ""does not diminish your ability to control your browsing choices. For example, you will be able to clear your browsing cache/history and cookies.""

That's a start, but I think we'd all like to hear Bezos respond to Markey with clearer answers.

Amazon was slapped with a patent infringement claim lawsuit over the Kindle Fire earlier this week. That case is causing controversy considering that some of the patents have become the established norm for tablets in general (and not just the Kindle Fire), including the act of tapping an icon on the tablet's touch-sensitive display to perform an action.

UPDATE: Amazon reminded us that users can completely turn off the split-browsing mode and use Amazon Silk like a conventional Web browser.

Samsung Galaxy S3 owners are subject to a vulnerability that can actually be fixed with an over-the-air update.

Samsung today said that users can install a security update over the air that will safeguard them from a vulnerability that could allow someone to remotely delete all of their personal data from the handset.

Security researcher Ravi Borgaonkar discovered the flaw and demonstrated it last week at a security conference in Argentina. The flaw lies in the way Samsung's TouchWiz UI handles unstructured supplementary service data codes, which are allowed to execute commands on the device's keypad. Most software dialers require users to hit the ""send"" button to complete a code, but Samsung's software does not, the researcher claims.

Malicious hackers who realized that took to the Web and unleashed malicious code that was capable of taking advantage of the flaw and remotely wiping the entire device. According to Borgaonkar, the flaw can be exploited through Web links, QR codes, and even SMS.

Samsung didn't say how it addressed the flaw, but reassured users that the issue ""has already been resolved."" Interestingly, Borgaonkar said that it was ""possible to exploit this attack only on Samsung devices.""

CNET has contacted Samsung for more information on the fix. We will update this story when he learn more.

Apple is bringing both 3D and a huge dose of GPS to its new Maps app for iOS.

The iPhone maker revealed today at WWDC a new in-house 3D Maps app built entirely from the ground up. The 3D option isn't turned on by default but can easily be switched on by the user via a large button logically dubbed 3D.

The Flyover feature displays 3D, photographic maps that you can rotate with your fingers to get a true view of any location. Why Flyover? Search for a location or landmark, and the app flies you over there to bring you the bird's-eye view. But 3D is also available in satellite view, slightly higher than your average bird can fly.

And 3D isn't the only cool feature. The app is tapping into the GPS arena by helping drivers trying to navigate their way through traffic.

Besides offering turn-by-turn directions, the app includes a new traffic service that shows you the location of accidents, courtesy of crowd-sourcing, so you can try to avoid them.

The app also displays the ETA for your destination and will try to uncover a better route when you're stuck in traffic. It even works when your iPhone or iPad is at the lock screen.

And you don't have to take your eyes off the road, since the app works with Siri. You can tell your device where you want to go, and Siri will speak the directions to you and alert you to where you have to go next.

Overall, the new Maps app sounds like a win for iOS users, but GPS device makers aren't likely to be too happy with the competition.

Google Chrome 12 beta (download for Windows | Mac | Linux) pushed a moderate range of under-the-hood improvements to Chrome beta users, including better hardware acceleration, stronger privacy controls, and slightly safer file downloads. It also killed support for Google Gears, a move the company announced back in March.

The new beta includes two security improvements. Flash-based local shared objects, which are bits of Web sites stored locally on your computer, can now be deleted from within Chrome's settings. In the past, you would have to use a special online tool from Adobe to remove them.

The second security enhancement that Chrome has expanded is security algorithms that check Web sites for malicious content to downloads. The browser will now natively prevent some malicious downloads from being saved on your computer. Note that this is not a full-powered replacement for your security software.

Improved hardware acceleration in Chrome 12 beta comes in the form of support for 3D CSS, which means that the browser will now leverage the processing power of your computer's graphics card when handling 3D animations written in CSS. This requires your graphics card drivers to be up to date.

Another change is built-in preliminary support for screen readers, which are programs that help the visually impaired by reading aloud what's on the screen when moving the mouse. The support includes readers such as JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver.

If Chrome 12 development stays on schedule, these improvements are expected to make it to the stable release about one month from now. The full Chrome changelog is available here.",html

Trillian lets you follow your conversations on mobile devices and unfamiliar computers without compromising your security, and its transparent privacy policy helps keep you informed, as well as safe. Trillian is available in several packages: an ad-supported Free version, an ad-free, Cloud-enhanced Pro version with an annual subscription, and a Lifetime version. Users must be 13 or older to access Trillian's network. We tried the latest freeware release, Trillian 5.3, in Windows 7.

Trillian offers several setup options, and the installer automatically removes old files if you're upgrading. We declined the option to run Trillian when Windows starts since we like a fast, clean boot with minimal Internet queries, but heavy chatters may prefer to get right at it. The first step is to sign in or create a new account; the next involves entering user names and passwords for Windows Live Messenger, Google Talk, ICQ, Skype, and other IM networks; and then just set up social networks: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Foursquare. Signing in is easy; just click the appropriate network or site and log on as usual. Trillian asks to access your data (accepted) and post to friends (declined) just like the networks you access, and we could also opt to stay signed in through Trillian. We configured the e-mail accounts we wanted Trillian to follow and pressed ""Done."" Electronic tones signaled the program's launch, and Trillian logged on and started following our conversations in a narrow window with browser-like features.

Trillian is so popular in part because it takes care of a nagging problem with chat apps: Too many apps and not enough chat. We're sure we still have forgotten accounts with some equally forgotten social networks; Trillian can help prevent that, and also the problem, perhaps more annoying, of falling behind in conversations because of forgetting to check a feed, site, or thread. So see for yourself why so many users stick with Trillian.",html

It's fast, geared for an Internet tether yet able function on its own, and it's a bold step into the future of how operating systems work. The Chrome OS will be available to the public on June 15, and Google and Samsung gave CNET an early look at the coming Samsung Chromebook.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

While only CNET's New York office received a review model early, the operating system constantly updates and so the San Francisco-based team was able to examine the latest version of Chrome OS on the original Chrome OS laptop, the Cr-48.

Basically, Chrome OS is a low-to-mid powered operating system that has the potential for mass appeal, much more so than what we saw back in December 2010 when the Cr-48 launched. Google has made some nifty improvements, all available on the Cr-48 because they're all enhancements to the operating system. There's a decent local file browser, for one thing, and the latest version of Chrome performs much better on the anemic Cr-48 hardware than the original version of Chrome OS did.

It's no mean feat that a company can improve performance simply by improving the software, and yet that appears to be what Google has accomplished. That means that older Chromebooks will still get better over time, despite their age. We also noticed that boot times improved, and of course browser speeds. When the Chrome OS launched, Chrome the browser was on version 8. It's now on version 12.

Yet the Chrome OS's strength in cloud-based flexibility is also its great weakness. If you don't have an Internet connection, you're in trouble. The promised offline support for Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Docs hasn't materialized at the time of writing, a mere week before the public launch of the Chromebooks. Wi-Fi and 3G connections are simply not prevalent enough at the moment to support constant connections from a smartphone, let alone a low-powered laptop. Without that tether to the Internet, and without offline support, the Chromebook is essentially a less-media friendly, less-touch friendly version of a tablet.

It's entirely possible this will change in the next week if Google pushes out updates to offline support. For now, though, the Chrome OS is an interesting concept idea that is at best before its time.",html

Competitive and diverse, this most essential of software categories has seen tremendous growth in the past year. Although we recommend Mozilla Firefox overall, check out why Opera and Chrome are strong alternatives.

Mozilla Firefox CNET editors' rating: 4.5 stars Mozilla Firefox made tabbed browsing mainstream and redefined the browser wars. The easiest browser on the market to customize, the huge user-developed plug-in database makes it supremely powerful, but that's not the only reason to use it. Specialized versions like Flock and Songbird emphasize social networking and music obsessions, but that's not why you need it, either. A JavaScript debugger is standard, and Firefox displays the page-source code in a new window, using indents and color-coded tags like an HTML editor. Again, not enough--on its own. Even the built-in pop-up blocker, antiphishing protections, and enhanced extension security aren't enough of a reason for using Firefox. Being one of the fastest browsers on the market? Aren't they all? But add together all those things under one roof, and you've got a full-featured, safe browsing experience with a nearly infinite level of customization.

Google Chrome CNET editors' rating: 4.0 stars Chrome is Google's attempt to make the Web browser disappear and to focus on the applications and pages users are viewing, rather than on the border with its tools. Some of Chrome's basic underpinnings are quite novel, but people will recognize other features, as they exist in other open-source Web browsers on the market today. Chrome is blazingly fast and is easily the quickest browser available. Based on Webkit, the same open-source engine that powers Apple Safari, Google's Android mobile platform, and several other Web-browsing tools, Chrome's interface is a drastic departure from other browsers. Instead of the traditional toolbar, Chrome puts its tabs on top. Moreover, the tabs are detachable: ""tabs"" and ""windows"" are interchangeable here. Detached tabs can be dragged and dropped into the browser, and tabs can be rearranged at any time. By isolating each tab's processes, when one site crashes, the other tabs do not. Chrome made some major improvements toward the end of 2009, and skins are now available. Extensions are limited to the developer's version, but they're expected soon, too. Only time and benchmarking tests will tell if they slow the browser down, but Chrome's rising popularity is undeniable.",html

In a meeting with reporters this week, Satya Nadella, senior vice president of Microsoft's search, portal and advertising platform group, said the company's browser will come with a private browsing mode. And Long Zheng of the istartedsomething blog surfaced two telling Microsoft trademarks that appear related: Cleartracks and Inprivate.

Stephen Shankland/CNET News

Both trademarks are involved with Web browsers, according to the applications with a July 30 filing date. The Cleartracks trademark involves ""computer programs for deleting search history after accessing Web sites,"" according to the Microsoft filing. And the Inprivate trademark involves ""computer programs for disabling the history and file caching features of a Web browser; and computer software for notifying a user of a Web browser when others are tracking Web use and for controlling the information others can access about such use.""

One obvious use case for privacy browsing modes is surfing the Net for pornographic materials without leaving traces, but other, less unseemly use cases also exist. ""Users may wish to begin a private browsing session to research a medical condition, or plan a surprise vacation or birthday party for a loved one,"" according to Mozilla's discussion of a private browsing feature.

Microsoft didn't comment on the applications beyond a brief statement, ""We are investing in privacy in IE8.""

And in a June blog posting, Microsoft said privacy is one of the major components of the ""trustworthy browsing"" element of Internet Explorer 8. ""The larger challenge here is notifying users clearly about what sites they're disclosing information to and enabling them to control that disclosure if they choose,"" the company said. Microsoft said privacy means ""the user is in control of what information the browser makes available to Web sites.""

Internet Explorer is the dominant Web browser, and version 8 is in beta testing now and due in final form later this year.

Programmers have envisioned a private browsing mode for Mozilla's Firefox browser but so far haven't put the privacy feature into the open-source browser. Apple's Safari has a private browsing mode.",html

With plenty of competitors breathing down its neck--Microsoft's IE9 in particular--Mozilla is fixing the final bugs that lie in the way of a Firefox 4 release.

Last night, Mozilla released Firefox 4 beta 10 (click to download for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux). This version focuses mostly on stability and performance rather than on new features--although one new option is the ability to start Firefox in safe mode by holding down shift when launching on Windows.

Flash should work better on Mac OS X with the new beta, and memory usage should be better, Mozilla said in a blog post yesterday.

Next up are one or two more beta versions, then the release candidates, and if all goes well, a final Firefox 4 release in February. In a planning message last night, release manager Christian Legnitto said Mozilla will build beta 11 and, if too many bugs remain unfixed, beta 12.

Mozilla recently divided its blocking bugs into two categories, soft and hard, with only the latter able to hold up release of the new software. As of Wednesday morning, excluding security bugs, there are 194 soft blockers and 76 hard blockers.

In practice, it won't make much difference whether Firefox 4 is released before Internet Explorer 9: most people don't change browsers that frequently. But competition is fierce right now, especially with Google's Chrome edging in on the early-adopter stronghold Firefox once had more to itself.

IE9, currently in beta testing, changes the competitive dynamic in the browser marketplace. Microsoft for years lagged rivals for support of new Web technologies. IE9 embraces many of them, though, and adds significantly improved performance at the same time. It's not clear when exactly IE9 will be released, but Microsoft's developer-oriented Mix conference in April seems a fitting venue.

One of the headline features in Firefox 4 is hardware acceleration using computers' graphics chips. However, Mozilla has decided to implement the feature cautiously to begin with to avoid crashes or other problems among its 400 million users. Specifically, Firefox 4 will disable hardware acceleration except with new graphics drivers and with a whitelist of video hardware makers: Intel, AMD, and Nvidia.

""We just want to minimize our initial risk here,"" graphics team member Joe Drew said in a mailing list discussion. Mozilla plans to remove the whitelist later, he said.",html

http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/the-free-windows-10-upgrade-expires-july-29/,The free Windows 10 upgrade expires July 29,"May,Pm,Tom Mcnamara",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"When Microsoft launched Windows 10 last year, it declared that the OS would be free to Windows 7 and 8.1 users until July 29, 2016, with a few exceptions. On May 6, the company reiterated this expiration date, possibly to address a rising tide of customers who were hoping for an extension. If you qualify for an upgrade but have not yet gotten a Windows 10 license, you'll need to go to Microsoft's website to get your copy before the offer expires.

The ""download now, install later"" Windows 10 option

You don't have to install the upgrade right away, though. Microsoft provides a free tool that will download a version of Windows 10 that you can burn onto a blank DVD, Blu-ray disc, or USB thumb drive, any of which you can use to install the OS whenever you're ready. This version of Windows 10 does not come with a product key, but if you use it to upgrade before July 29, you won't need one. If you already have a product key for Windows 10, you can use it with this version at any time, because that key does not expire.

If you previously installed Windows 7 or 8.1 from a retail disc (or you purchased Windows 8.0 at retail and installed the free upgrade to 8.1) and you install the free Windows 10 upgrade, then you effectively have a retail copy of Windows 10. You can use your product key to install Windows 10 on a different machine in the future, as long as you remove it from the old machine first. However, if Windows 7, 8.0, or 8.1 came pre-installed on a computer you bought, then you are limited to the OEM license and can't transfer the Windows product key to another computer.

Upgrading from Windows XP or Windows Vista

You can't upgrade directly from Windows XP or Vista to Windows 10; you must purchase a copy of Windows instead. Installing Windows 10 on such a machine requires erasing the drive that contains the old version of Windows, so before you do anything, back up your files to an external drive and/or the cloud. You will basically be starting from scratch.

Windows XP users cannot directly upgrade to any version of Windows 7 or 10.

Vista users can directly upgrade to Windows 7, then upgrade to Windows 10 for free, as long as you do so before July 26. However, if your Vista is 32-bit, you cannot install the 64-bit version of Windows 10 without wiping the drive first. Your alternative is to install the 32-bit version of Windows 10. This version is unable to use more than about 3.5GB of system RAM.

The good news: websites like Amazon are still selling legit OEM versions of Windows 7 for around $50, so getting Windows 7 and the free Windows 10 upgrade now is cheaper than buying Windows 10 outright. This cheaper version of Windows 7 is 32-bit, but the 64-bit Windows 10 installer will accept this product key.",html

Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux machines, Firefox 4 beta 1 is Mozilla's first official peek into the future of the world's second most popular browser.

The interface changes in this first beta version are the most apparent, and they might take some users time to get used to, unless you've been playing around with the Firefox nightly builds. Tabs are now on top, by default, at least in the Windows version. In its changelog, Mozilla promises that tabs-on-top will come to the Linux and Mac versions of Firefox, when the default themes on those two operating systems receive updates. This can be toggled under the Customize option under the menu button, labeled ""Firefox,"" in the upper-left corner of the interface.

The menu button is also new to Firefox, but not to browsing in general, as Mozilla follows the lead here of other browsers. Google Chrome has always had tabs on top, and Opera earlier this year compacted its menu bar behind a single drop-down menu in the upper-left corner. Bookmarks have also received the button treatment, though you can resurrect the bookmarks bar easily enough. In this beta version of Firefox, only Windows Vista and Windows 7 users will see it.

There are other tangible changes to the browser. You can now search for open tabs from the smart location bar, and the Stop and Reload interface buttons have been merged into one. The add-on interface has been overhauled, but don't get too used to it; Mozilla says it's a work in progress, so you can expect its look to continue to evolve. Mozilla hopes to have the new, lightweight Jetpack framework in place for when Firefox 4 is out of beta testing later this year.

The out-of-process plug-in protection that debuted for Windows and Linux users in Firefox 3.6.4, but has been restricted to the beta builds for Mac, comes fully activated for all three platforms in this beta. This keeps crashes in Adobe System's Flash, Microsoft's Silverlight, and Apple's QuickTime from pulling down the entire browser.

Firefox 4 beta also sees significant improvements to Firefox under the hood. There's a new HTML5 parser, and support for more HTML5 form controls than in previously released Firefox betas or the nightly builds. The HTML5 WebM video format for HD is natively supported, and APIs have been improved for Websockets, HTML History, and JS-ctypes, a foreign function interface for extensions. CSS transitions are partially supported too.

Some features in Firefox 4 but have been turned off by default, for now, including full WebGL support and an experimental Direct2D rendering back end for Windows. Mac users will see a core animation rendering model for plug-ins on their operating system, which means that plug-ins that support it should be able to draw faster and more efficiently.

In security, Firefox 4 so far introduces a minor but useful change. CSS "":visited"" selectors now prevent Web sites from checking a user's browsing history. There are plans for an account manager and a content security policy to help detect and prevent attacks.

Mozilla said in its blog post announcing the new beta version on Tuesday that users can expect updates about every two weeks. There's also a prominent ""feedback"" button to the right of the location bar, which Mozilla has already begun using to get feedback about the browser. The full changelog for Firefox 4 beta 1 details even more changes made to the browser, and it hints at what's coming, as development of the browser proceeds.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20011442-264.html,Google ethos speeds up Chrome release cycle,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"What's better: short trains that leave frequently or longer trains that leave less often?

Given Google programmers' philosophy of releasing products early then iterating often, it's no surprise that higher frequency is their preference: thus the announcement Thursday that Google will speed up the release cycle of its Chrome browser.

New stable versions of Chrome today arrive about every three months, but Google wants to double that pace, said Chrome Program Manager Anthony LaForge.

""Under the old model, when we faced a deadline with an incomplete feature, we had three options, all undesirable: (1) Engineers had to rush or work overtime to complete the feature by the deadline, (2) We delayed the release to complete that feature (which affected other unrelated features), or (3) The feature was disabled and had to wait approximately 3 months for the next release. With the new schedule, if a given feature is not complete, it will simply ride on the the next release train when it's ready,"" he said in the blog.

That could mean, for example that some features such as print preview that Google punted from Chrome 6 to Chrome 7 could arrive in mainstream Chrome users' hands earlier.

Browser rival Mozilla is working on the same idea of more frequent releases. As with Chrome, though, it doesn't mean the pace of advancement doubles, only that new features arrive in smaller doses but more often.

For decades, distribution was a difficult matter for the software industry. AT&T and UC Berkeley Unix programmers mailed tapes to one another. And when personal computers caught on, floppy disks and later CDs also relied on the postal service. Software that dates from this era--Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop, Civilization--tends toward major updates released years apart.

Google, of course, grew up in the Internet era, when the network could be used to send software. Google likes its software to be updated silently, behind the scenes, and with no user intervention--in short, the way Google updates its search engine algorithm.

Of course, there's still a lot of overhead in releasing software, even as an online update. New versions must be debugged, tested, packaged up, and sent over the wire. It's often easier to handle one bigger train than two small ones. But Google believes its new release process, to be implemented in coming months, will also make project management easier in many ways.

It remains to be seen how amenable Google's philosophy will be to IT organizations accustomed to testing software and controlling its release. Certainly many employees rely constantly on Google's ever-changing search engine, which corporate IT doesn't get to test. But software that runs on a company's computers brings security risks and compatibility challenges not present when visiting a Web site.

Realistically, a release cycle of six weeks rather than three months won't make too much difference to corporate IT geared for cycles many times that duration, so Google's move to turn the crank faster probably won't change things much.

A broader issue also is involved: how fast can people keep up? User interface changes can leave people clicking around in menus and dialog boxes for commands they once knew how to find.

As Chrome spreads beyond the early-adopter crowd, change gets harder. But that might not sound as much at odds with a faster release cycle as one might think. Many Chrome changes are under the hood, such as improvements to JavaScript processing speed, and many others enable Web programmers to exercise new options.

In other words, Chrome is a window on the Web, and it will often be up to Web site owners to worry about making sure people don't suffer future shock.",html

Just like last year, Jessica Dolcourt and I have split up the iPhone apps of the year into two groups. Jessica has put together the iPhone Starter Kit that's perfect for grabbing the best productivity apps to make your life more...productive. My job is quite the opposite. I went through my favorite games of 2009 (and quickly realized I had too many), and was able to narrow it down to 17 of my most played games. If you're looking to waste some time, this collection was made for you!

I tried to make a collection of games that would have something for everyone, so I included quick casual games along with strategy, tower defense, first-person shooters, word games, and more. Obviously, I recommend every game in this list, but hopefully you'll be able to find a genre you like so you have something to play over the holidays.

Without further ado, here are my favorite games for 2009.

Orbital is a game that starts out with a very simple concept, but after you spend some time with the game, you'll realize it's much more than it seems. The object is to shoot orbs onto the playing field and to hit them three times with subsequent orbs in order to score a point and make them disappear. As your playing field fills up, you'll need to make increasingly precise shots to lower your orbs' hit count and hopefully keep the orb you shot in an area that doesn't block later shots. Obviously, it's very confusing to explain, but once you play for a few minutes it will all become clear. You can also play multiplayer on the same device with a player on each end--great for an across-the-table match. Overall, Orbital is an excellent pick-up-and-play type of experience, with slick yet simple graphics, great for a quick game wherever you are and challenging enough to keep you coming back for more. I highly recommend this game.

Though Harbor Master wasn't the first line-drawing game of its type (Flight Control was first and remains a great game in its own right), the variation in gameplay and continued attention from the developer put it at the top of its class. The object of the game is to direct boats to open berths where they can offload their cargo, and then to draw a path for them to leave the playing area. There are several maps to choose from, all with unique features to make the game more interesting; some require that specific colored cargo be dropped off at appropriate berths, while others challenge you to blow up a pirate ship that harasses your boats. There are several maps already available, each with its own challenges, and the developer continues to improve and add more content for free.

The original Geodefense became known as the thinking man's tower defense game, requiring players to work out a strategy for harder levels (and they were very challenging). GeoDefense is still one of the best tower defense games in the iTunes App Store, and its much-hyped follow-up, Geodefense Swarm, offers more of the same insanely challenging gameplay, but with a twist. GeoDefense Swarm has 30 playable levels split between Easy, Medium, and Hard categories, all offering the same vector-based graphics, pixel bursts, and warp effects found in the original. But Geodefense Swarm does away with the fixed path concept in Geodefense, and adds tiles that speed up and slow down creeps, a new tower called the Thumper, and several increasingly challenging maps to play. With no fixed path, you'll need to create your own using towers in creative ways to maximize damage on creeps as they travel to their goal. Overall, GeoDefense Swarm is an excellent follow-up to the original game, but just like the original, might be better suited to those with a lot of experience in the genre or at least a high threshold for frustration.

Homerun Battle 3D lets you participate in a home run derby to beat your best score or challenge other players online. The control system is excellent: tilt your iPhone or iPod Touch to adjust where you will swing in the strike zone. When the pitch crosses the plate, touch the screen anywhere to swing. It takes some practice to be able to line up your bat with different types of pitches, but you get the hang of it fairly quickly. The challenge is in hitting several home runs in a row, which you'll need to practice if you plan on trying your luck against other skilled players online. The system for online matching with other players is superb, letting you start playing almost immediately. As you play, you can even see how your opponent is doing with a picture-in-picture display in the upper right part of your screen. If you'd like to hit a few out of the park, this home run hitter is an excellent choice with good-looking 3D graphics, customizable uniforms, great controls, and seamless online gameplay.

Modern Combat: Sandstorm is a first-person shooter that might be the best one available at the iTunes App Store. The game is set somewhere in the Middle East, with mission objectives in dry sandy locales. You have three different types of control schemes to pick from, with variations of onscreen joysticks and touch-screen actions. Whether you're gunning through the missions or take the game online against other players, Modern Combat: Sandstorm provides great shoot-'em-up action and great gameplay. Along with the great gameplay, the game also has great audio, with explosive-sounding guns, and good voice acting in-game and during cut scenes. Overall, if you're looking for a solid first-person shooter with good single player to come to the iPhone, Modern Combat: Sandstorm is an excellent choice with exciting gameplay, challenging missions, and a control scheme that's fairly easy to get used to. The new addition of multiplayer is only icing on the cake.

Eliminate Pro is an extremely well-polished ""free"" game featuring smooth-looking graphics, onscreen controls that are fairly effective (no match for a controller or keyboard/mouse setup, but that's to be expected), a number of power-ups to improve your weapons and armor, and several playable maps. In-game kills and winning matches earn you credits you can use to buy new weapons and armor. There are eight armor types, five weapon types, and items to buy like armor designs (skins) to give you a new look. The best part is that you get to play an online FPS from wherever you are on 3G or Wi-Fi against your friends or against players from around the world. The game uses the Plus+ network, so you'll need to register your character before you start playing online. The only catch to this game is that once your energy bar is depleted, you will not earn credits for purchasing items, and will need to wait an hour for more energy or pay for more battery cells. But even with the pricing model, casual gamers will love this game for its smooth graphics and online multiplayer action.

What can I say about Scrabble? I hardly need to describe how to play this classic board game, but making it into an online iPhone game makes it better than ever before. When you play against an online opponent, your move is sent instantaneously to wherever they are in the world. You can challenge your Facebook friends, random players who love the game, or against a savvy AI for quick solo games. Perhaps best of all, you can play Scrabble with a relative (Hi Mom!) and have a pleasant long-distance connection through a classic game. A built-in dictionary, push notifications for when it's your move, and a ""Teacher"" that shows you the best word you could have used after your turn make this game a must-have for word-game junkies.

Alive4Ever is part survival shooter and part RPG in which you'll fight off zombies using onscreen joysticks and has more than a little resemblance to popular PC game, Left4Dead (even the name!). It's similar to iDracula: Undead Awakening (another great game), a survival shooter, but adds several new elements to make it even better. In Alive4Ever, you get to choose among four different characters with varying strengths and weaknesses and play through 30 missions of increasingly hard zombie-killing mayhem. When you're low on health or ammo, you can often fight your way to pickups to replenish your supplies. As you complete missions, you'll earn experience to increase your character's abilities and extra cash to buy new and more-powerful weapons. You can even play co-op multiplayer over Bluetooth with your friends. Overall, Alive4Ever is an excellent and well-thought-out app that combines good elements of two popular games to make one of the best survival shooters for the iPhone.

When I first saw Minigore I had trouble taking it seriously. There were already a few dual-joystick survival shooters available like Alive4Ever and iDracula (both linked above), so a similar game with a cute big-headed protagonist and fuzzy bad guys just didn't seem appealing to me. Once I played the game I realized just how special it was. Even with the cute graphics, Minigore manages to be one of the best games of this type I have played, with excellent sound design, genuinely funny voice acting, and an overall great gaming experience. Pick up and use several different types of weapons as the game progresses as you fight bigger and badder fuzzy enemies. The developer of Minigore continues to improve the game with new characters to play and new baddies to conquer using a wide array of devastating weapon types. Beginning and expert survival shooter fans will enjoy the challenge and polished graphics (even if they are cutesy) in this fun game.

Meteor Blitz is a challenging 2D survival shooter arcade game with smooth graphics, tons of cool power-ups, and great gameplay. Like many games of this type on the iPhone, Meteor Blitz uses dual onscreen joysticks, with the left one to move your ship and the right to fire your weapons. A double tap on the left joystick gives you a momentary burst of speed to help you get out of particularly sticky situations. Just over the right joystick is a button to switch between three weapon types: regular cannons, a flame thrower, and ice bullets, all of which can be upgraded by spending rings you collect in the game. Each weapon type is more effective against specific enemies (ice bullets for red meteors, flame thrower for ice meteors, etc.) so knowing how to quickly switch between them becomes part of the challenge as well. With two game types, real-time ranking as you play, and a nostalgic nod to arcade classics of old, Meteor Blitz might be my favorite game overall for 2009. It might be because I grew up playing games like this, but I think just about anyone who likes shoot-'em-up action will love this game.

Not looking for a hardcore shooter game? SkeeBall, from longtime Mac-gaming publisher Freeverse Software, is just like the bowling game you remember from your childhood, but uses your touch screen to throw a ball down the alley. Using crisp 3D graphics and a realistic physics engine, this game manages to capture what it's like to play Skeeball in an arcade. Each game you get 10 balls you can roll down the alley in an attempt to make them land in one of the seven cups of varying score values. Tilt your iPhone to add spin as your ball rolls down the alley. While playing, random cups will light up, and if you manage to land a ball in the cup, you get a score multiplier, which lasts until the end of the game. Hit another lit-up cup to increase your multiplier. At the end, you receive tickets--depending on your score--that you can use to purchase silly items in the store. Overall, this simple game is a great time waster that doesn't require expert hand-eye coordination, but manages to be a lot of fun.

Real Racing is my favorite of all the racing games with excellent graphics, different camera views, more than 40 cars in four classes, 12 unique tracks, and five game modes--most of which you will unlock as you win races. You also can sync your best times against other players online and even join a league to rise up through the ranks against people across the globe. Excellent goal-oriented gameplay (new cars and tracks) keeps you playing, and an online component that's more than just a high-score list makes you want to get better. But what makes me like this game over all other racing sim-type games for iPhone are the sensitive, but realistic feeling controls, including an autobraking system that helps you learn the ropes to become a better racer. If you like racing games, there are a lot to choose from at the iTunes App Store, but Real Racing offers the most polish and excellent gameplay.

There have been a few good off-road racing games in the iTunes App Store, but none had the polish and natural-feeling controls of ATV Offroad. With amazing graphics and excellent physics, the gameplay involves racing through challenges and multirace competitions to unlock more tracks. There also are freestyle, quick race, and multiplayer modes, but you'll need to be on the same Wi-Fi network to race against your friends. ATV Offroad sets itself apart from other racing games the second you hit the track with smooth-looking graphics and excellent accelerometer-based controls. You can even pull off huge tricks while in the air by hitting onscreen trick buttons. You can choose between three skill levels, though I found even the medium skill level to be very hard to beat. If you don't like the look of your racer, you can easily switch between multiple ATV designs and different-color leathers with a swipe of your finger before a race. If you like off-road racing, I highly recommend this game.

Jet Car Stunts is a stunt-racing game that runs surprisingly smoothly on first-gen iPhones on up to the 3GS. Beyond the beautiful graphics, the driving-control system is excellent, using the accelerometer for steering and onscreen controls for gas and brakes. What make the game stand apart from other racing games are the controls for your rocket boost to complete big jumps, and the braking system that works both on the ground and in the air. You can choose from two different game types including Time Trial and Platforming. In Time Trial, you race five laps around a track with corkscrew twists, tight turns, and huge jumps, to qualify for bronze-, silver-, or gold-medal times. Platforming has no time limit, but instead records the number of tries it takes you to complete difficult tracks--and they get very difficult in both game types. Overall, the unique gameplay and smooth graphics on all iPhone models make this an easy pick for best of 2009. If you like to go for ""big air,"" this is the game for you.

Backbreaker Football is not a ""complete"" football game like Madden NFL 10 or NFL 2010; it instead focuses on the challenge of running around defenders to make touchdowns. Control your runner by tilting your phone, forward to run, and left and right to turn. Onscreen buttons give you a variety of moves to make defenders miss including right and left juke moves, spin moves, and a turbo button to break free for the touchdown. There's also a showboat button so you can high-step into the end zone. Each move has a certain point value and when you string moves together (or showboat for more yards before the end zone) you get more points to add to your score. The great thing about Backbreaker Football is that it doesn't take an enormous amount of time to play a few waves (running the distance of the field), so it's easy to get some quick playing time in wherever you are. Overall, if you're looking for an American football game minus the need to play an entire game or sift through giant playbooks, Backbreaker Football offers enough football action to be a lot of fun.

HookChamp is a fun (and funny) platform type of game where you swing through caves carrying stolen treasure using your trusty grappling hook to get to the exit. The game offers fairly simple graphics and reminds me of older console platform games. The control system is extremely easy to pick up and understand, but takes some practice before you'll be able to swing smoothly through the caverns. Along the way, you'll need to pick up gold coins, some of which require you to be creative with your high-flying grappling techniques. As you progress in levels, the action gets more difficult, as you'll be chased by a giant unnamed ghost-like creature with large teeth. Some of the most exciting parts of the game are when you're on the run, trying to swing your way to safety. HookChamp is not going to dazzle you with modern graphics, but the game concept is solid and the controls translate well to the touch screen, making this an excellent choice on the iPhone or iPod Touch.

Late addition:

N.O.V.A. - Near Orbit Vanguard Alliance just came out, but might be the best first-person shooter yet, so I decided to add it at the last second. Using much of the same controls as Modern Combat: Sandstorm (reviewed above), N.O.V.A. challenges you to unravel the mystery of several attacks on orbiting installations. The smooth graphics remind me of the Halo games visually, and the sound effects are excellent, with the notable exception of the voice acting, which is not so great. You can play a huge single-player mission across several levels or take the game online and play death-match games with other players. Overall, N.O.V.A. just might unseat all others as the best FPS for iPhone and iPod Touch, so I just had to add this one to the list.

What do you think? What are your favorite games of 2009? Any glaring omissions? Let me know in the comments!

With June nearly halfway over, the clock is ticking for Apple to make good on releasing the next major version of its Final Cut Pro X video editing software this month. A new report from Japanese Mac blog Macotakara claims that release is going down next week, and will coincide with announcements of several new third-party ThunderBolt-enabled peripherals.

Apple first debuted the updated video editing software at the Supermeet event, which took place during the National Association of Broadcasters event in Las Vegas in April. There, the company provided a demo of the new features and announced the $299 price tag; at that time, it said Final Cut Pro X would be released sometime in June.

Final Cut Pro X is a followup to Final Cut Pro 7, software Apple released in 2009 as part of Final Cut Studio. The new version represents a complete 64-bit rewrite of Final Cut, and blends in functionality of other software programs that were included as part of the Studio suite.

Apple is only offering it as a standalone download through the Mac App Store, where the company also sells Aperture 3, its pro photo editing and library software. The Mac App Store is on its way to replacing the boxed software the company sells, including major system software updates. Apple last week announced that the only way it would offer the upgrade to Mac OS X 10.7 ""Lion"" would be through the Mac App Store, ending a long history of providing optical discs to customers.

To coincide with the release, Macotakara says that additional third-party products featuring Intel and Apple's ThunderBolt technology will be announced. Final Cut Pro has been closely tied to the launch of that I/O technology, with demos showing multiple, uncompressed high-definition video streams being pumped through the software in order to show how much data can go back and forth between ThunderBolt-equipped Macs and peripherals. That will become even more of a showcase with Final Cut Pro X, which can handle 4K- and 5K-size video streams.",html

Editors' note: CNET's rated review of the Apple iPad is now available.

The Apple iPad is an unprecedented device. It doesn't shoot rainbows or make puppies, but this roughly 8x10-inch tablet computer melds your laptop, smartphone, gaming console, and iPod into a single, affordable, unfortunately named thing.

Of course, we come to you with a standard list of complaints. The absence of an integrated video camera puts the kibosh on any hope of using the iPad for video chats, and without Flash video support, many Web pages look like Swiss cheese. But the biggest problem with the device is coming up with bullet-proof reasons to buy one.

Because the iPad is an entirely new class of device, you'll probably need to lie to yourself a little to justify the purchase. But at this point, any CNET readers worth their salt have mastered the art of making excuses to buy new gadgets.

For the uninitiated, Apple has posted a cheat sheet of demo videos that provide a smorgasbord of reasonable answers to the question: ""Why do I need an iPad?"" To hear Apple tell it, the iPad is a Web browser for your living room, an e-book reader for the den, a movie player for the kids, a photo album, a jukebox, a gamer's best friend, a word processor, an e-mail machine, and a YouTube junkie's dream come true. No excuse good enough for you? Wait a few minutes and a developer will inevitably make an app for it.

Whatever you need to tell yourself to buy an iPad, we can safely say the device is a worthwhile addition to any wired home. We don't give much weight to the pundits who say that the iPad is the future of the personal computer, but we think it's the most entertaining gadget we'll see all year.

What is it, exactly?

If you're coming to this review already versed on the nitty gritty of what the iPad is and its roots in the iPhone and iPod Touch, feel free to skip ahead. Otherwise, here's the scoop:

The iPad is a touch-screen tablet computer, roughly the size of a magazine, with three models that connect to the Internet strictly over Wi-Fi (16GB for $499, 32GB for $599, 64GB for $699) and three that use a combination of Wi-Fi and AT&T's 3G wireless (16GB for $629, 32GB for $729, and 64GB for $829--pay-as-you go for the data subscription).

The iPad runs the same software found on Apple's popular iPhone and iPod Touch. Apple calls this software the iPhone OS, and it's generally regarded as one of the most successful operating systems designed for use with touch-screen devices. Unlike conventional computer OS software, designed around the mouse and the keyboard, the iPhone OS responds only to touch input and is generally capable of running only one application at a time.

If you've ever used an iPhone or iPod Touch, the iPad will feel immediately familiar. Out of the box, you get many of the iPhone's capabilities, including Apple-designed applications (apps) for Web browsing, e-mail, maps, photos, music, video, YouTube, and more. More apps can be installed using the built-in App Store software or by connecting the iPad to iTunes via your computer using the included cable. If you already own apps purchased for an iPhone or iPod Touch, you can transfer these apps to the iPad, as well.

Design

Apple rarely skimps on design and the iPad is no exception. The screen is made of the same oleophobic-coated glass as the iPhone 3GS', making it relatively easy to wipe away fingerprints. Behind the glass is an LED-backlit, 9.7-inch capacitive touch screen that uses IPS (in-plane switching) technology for above-average viewing angles.

Below the screen sits a home button that looks and behaves exactly like the one on the iPhone and iPod Touch, bouncing you out of any open app and placing you back in the main menu. Matte aluminum wraps around the backs and sides of the iPad, tapering a bit around the edges. If you've ever held one of Apple's unibody MacBooks, you know exactly the kind of feel and finish of the iPad's aluminum. Unlike the polished chrome of the iPod or glossy plastic of the iPhone, the back of the iPad seems less likely to show wear. Of course--as with any Apple product--there are already hundreds of cases for the iPad, should you feel the need to give it extra protection.

The iPad measures 7.47 inches wide by 9.56 inches tall by 0.5 inch thick, and weighs 1.5 pounds (or 1.6 pounds for the 3G model). Held in your hands, the dimensions and heft have a natural, magazine-like feel. Like the iPhone and iPod Touch, the iPad sports a finger-friendly OS with an onscreen QWERTY keyboard, and an accelerometer that can detect whether the device is in portrait or landscape mode. The buttons, switches, and ports around the edges of the iPad also mimic those of the iPhone. A 30-pin dock connector sits on the bottom, along with a small integrated speaker. On the right edge you have a volume rocker and a switch that works to disable the iPad's automatic screen rotation in case you need to look at something sideways without the iPad assuming you want it rotated.

The iPad's refined feel and high-quality materials won't surprise Apple devotees, but in the larger landscape of tablets, Netbook computers, and e-readers, the design feels distinctly upscale--especially given its price. Next to the Asus Eee PC, Amazon Kindle, or Fusion Garage JooJoo, the iPad looks like it was made on a different planet (where plastic doesn't exist). We don't make the point to be snobby, but looks matter considering that all these devices are marketed as living-room accessories.

Size also matters. As one of the first tablet computers to go mainstream, you'll need to assess the iPad's size on a case-by-case basis. For the advertised purposes of Web browsing, reading books, and checking your e-mail, we found the magazine-size screen perfectly adequate. After years of watching videos on devices like the iPod Touch, or even dedicated video players like the Archos 5, video playback on the iPad's 9.7-inch screen feels downright luxurious.

For all its charms, however, the iPad is not as portable as we'd like. Part of the problem is psychological. Logically, you know the iPad's dimensions are no less portable than a book. But when a book costs between $500 and $800 and is made of glass, you treat it differently. Without being tucked away in a messenger bag or protective case, walking outside with an iPad in your hand feels like slapping the laws of gravity in the face.

We'd also be lying if we didn't say we wish the iPad could be a little thinner and lighter. At 1.5 pounds and half an inch thick, it makes most Netbooks look bloated, but the iPad is slightly heavier and thicker than most dedicated e-book readers, including the relatively large Kindle DX. If your dream is to relax in a hammock with an e-book in one hand and a tropical drink in the other, plan to avoid the iPad's glass screen hurtling toward your face when you doze off.

iPhone OS

Unlike many of the tablet-style devices we've encountered, the iPad doesn't run a conventional OS (operating system) such as Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X. Instead, Apple decided to use the mobile version of OS X from what is arguably its most successful and fastest-growing product: the iPhone .

In our view, Apple's use of the iPhone OS distinguishes the iPad from the competition. As dozens of iPad alternatives come out of the woodwork, touting all sorts of advantages and added features, the iPad will remain the only tablet computer on the market with access to Apple's App Store.

For the most part, the iPhone OS feels like a natural fit for a device like this. You don't need to worry about traditional computer headaches, such as scattered files on your desktop, installing drivers for third-party hardware, or trying to figure out where you put a downloaded image. Instead, all your apps are clearly laid out, organized in a grid of nickel-size icons that respond to a single touch. If you download an image from a Web page or e-mail, it appears in your photo library, without fail. If you need to search for anything--a song, an e-mail, a photo, or a Web page--double-clicking the home button brings up a Spotlight search feature that covers just about everything on the device. On the iPad, the organizational metaphor of the folder does not exist, and the effect feels liberating.

We think that most users will appreciate this simplicity and reliability compared with a traditional, budget-priced personal computer. Some of you, however, will probably feel suffocated by Apple's totalitarian control over the iPad's OS. If you get a kick out of running your computer using command lines and viewing device contents as a hierarchical file tree, the iPad will probably give you an aneurysm.

Purchasing software and media on the device makes Apple's ""walled-garden"" approach to the iPhone OS frustrating to a wider audience. The only way for users to purchase and download movies and music on the iPad is to use Apple's integrated iTunes store. If you want to buy new software for the device, you'll need to go through Apple's integrated App Store, which displays only applications deemed acceptable by Apple. Compared with the more laissez-faire approach of a Windows Netbook, for example, the iPad user is giving away freedom of choice in exchange for convenience. (One upside: In theory, Apple's top-down control over the iPhone OS and the commerce within it also serves to minimize the iPad's vulnerability to computer viruses.)

Everything old is new again

You can't place calls with the iPad (at least, not without a VoIP app) or easily text message your friends, but the other built-in capabilities are essentially the same as those on the iPhone 3GS.

That said, the iPad can be pushed much further than any non-laptop mobile device we've tested, including the iPhone. Because of the iPad's extra screen size, default apps such as the Safari Web browser, e-mail, iPod, video, maps, photos, and YouTube all look and behave much more like full-blown applications. The iPad's e-mail app, for example, is a doppelganger for the Mail application in Apple OS X, offering an overview of your in-box alongside the text of any currently selected message. The photos app could easily be mistaken for Apple's iPhoto, with its opening view of photos arranged in event-specific stacks. The iPod app looks and behaves like an abbreviated version of iTunes, for better or worse. And the YouTube app plays out like a prettier version of the actual Web site. Paradoxically, the two apps that have changed the least, Maps and the Safari browser, give the most radically different experience thanks to the iPad's big screen.

Size is meaningless without grace. Luckily, the iPad has both qualities in equal measure, helped by a new 1GHz Apple A4 processor, capacitive multitouch display technology, and an integrated Wi-Fi antenna compatible with the latest 802.1n wireless spec. Apps launch within seconds; waking from sleep mode is nearly instantaneous; and even a cold boot-up takes just 10 seconds. Even if your local Wi-Fi network isn't up to 802.11n speeds, the Web-browsing experience often feels faster than on an iPhone or iPod Touch on the same network, simply because you're doing a lot less scrolling and zooming to get to the information you need.

Other hardware features include Bluetooth 2.1, a stereo audio output (headphone jack), a built-in speaker, an integrated lithium ion rechargeable battery, NAND flash memory, an integrated accelerometer (tilt sensor), and an ambient light sensor. Apple's third-generation iPod Touch can claim many of the same features, but lacks the iPad's integrated digital compass, built-in microphone, and mute switch. It's also worth noting that the iPad's speaker is noticeably louder than the speaker included on the iPhone and iPod Touch, with a slightly beefier sound (though still ugly to listen to). Apple doesn't include earbuds with the iPad, so do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a nice pair.

A 3G wireless-compatible version of the iPad is also available, which includes a SIM card tray, as well as assisted GPS capabilities.

Bluetooth

Just like the iPhone 3GS and iPod Touch, the iPad includes wireless Bluetooth audio capabilities. We tested the iPad with an Altec Lansing BackBeat stereo Bluetooth headset, and the audio quality was on par with results from the third-generation iPod Touch. The pairing process was easy and incident-free. In the music player, a small Bluetooth icon appears next to the player controls and toggles audio back and forth between the speaker and the headset. The iPad's Bluetooth capabilities also allow peer-to-peer networking for gaming and wireless keyboard support for compatible writing applications.

iTunes Store and App Store

In the same way the iPad's apps all look and behave much more like Apple's full-blown OS X applications, the iPad's integrated iTunes Store could easily be mistaken for the desktop iTunes Store. Size aside, all the same capabilities are here, including movie rentals and purchases, TV show downloads, audiobooks, and access to iTunes U. You can pay for purchases by setting up an iTunes account with a credit card, or by redeeming iTunes gift cards.

The same can be said for the iPad version of the App Store; it looks and acts more like the store experience within Apple's iTunes software. Because the App Store is running on the iPad, however, the default display will bring up apps that are optimized specifically for the iPad.

Apple is encouraging developers to create new apps specifically for the iPad, which are not necessarily backward-compatible with the iPhone or iPod Touch. Because this is potentially an expensive proposition for users, we would like it to be easier to distinguish between an app designed for the iPhone and the same app designed for the iPad. There are dual-compatibility apps on offer that include both iPad versions and iPhone versions embedded within the same file, which Apple specially designates with a ""+"" symbol within the iPad App Store. We wish more apps were bundled this way to ensure broad compatibility, but we understand there's more money to be made in selling apps separately.

Fortunately, in the world of apps, the iPad is at the top of the food chain. Most apps designed for the iPhone or Touch can run on the iPad, either scaled-up to fit the screen, or presented at their original resolution framed at the center of the screen in black. This capability is good news for anyone bringing their existing apps over from an iPhone or iPod Touch, although users will likely want to purchase separate iPad-optimized versions of the apps they use regularly, which could get pricey.

Accessories

Beyond the deluge of third-party accessories already hitting store shelves, Apple is offering a handful of its own accessories for the iPad, including a physical keyboard with an integrated dock ($69), a charging dock without the keyboard ($29) that engages the iPad's photo frame mode, a camera connection kit ($30) that includes both a USB and an SD card adapter for importing images from a digital camera, and a wrap-around leather case ($40) that doubles as a kickstand.

If you're interested in using the iPad for presentations, Apple offers a $30 VGA adapter that can connect to a projector or computer monitor. Video output is only compatible with specific apps, such as Apple's Keynote. The maximum output resolution is only 1,024x768 pixels, so keep your HD expectations in check.

We'll be working on writing up individual reviews for several of these accessories, which we will link to as they become available. Off hand, though, we believe a protective case of some kind is a good investment. Also, given the alternative of charging the iPad using a basic wall adapter, $29 seems a fair price for a charging dock that transforms an otherwise techy device into an attractive digital photo frame.

Requirements

Though the iPad can be used without a computer most of the time, you will need to connect to a computer running Apple's iTunes 9.1 or later to set up the device and sync any existing media, contacts, e-mail, photos, or browser bookmarks. Computer specification requirements for iTunes 9.1 can be found on Apple's Web site.

If you plan to use the iPad at home for surfing the Web and you don't have a 3G-capable model, you will need to make sure your home is set up for wireless Internet.

iPad 3G

One of the big questions facing potential buyers is whether to buy an iPad model that supports wireless 3G service. (The 3G models won't be available till late April, according to Apple's Web site.) The benefit of 3G support is that you can use it to access Web and e-mail through the iPad anywhere with AT&T 3G wireless coverage. For a device so heavily focused on the Internet, the extra freedom of 3G compatibility is a clear advantage. Aside from a negligible added heft of 0.1 pound and the fact that buyers are paying an extra $130 for the 3G capability (compared with Wi-Fi-only models), there's no downside to owning a 3G-compatible model. Unlike the data plans for most smartphones, the iPad doesn't come with any contractual obligations. If you don't end up using the iPad's 3G capability, you can cancel the data plan at any time.

In fact, Apple and AT&T are offering a pretty good deal on 3G service for the iPad. There are two options: $15 a month for 250MB of data, or unlimited data for $29.99 a month. Each option can be prepaid for a month in advance. The 3G service is compatible with only the iPad models that offer both Wi-Fi and 3G, which are priced at $629 (16GB), $729 (32GB), and $829 (64GB).

Another advantage to the 3G-compatible iPad is the extra capability of assisted-GPS, allowing users to accurately pinpoint their locations on a map, making the device more useful for navigation and location-aware apps, such as restaurant finders and tour guides. The Wi-Fi-only models of the iPad can use rudimentary Wi-Fi hot-spot triangulation techniques to guess locations, but are much less accurate and consistent.

If you have no plans on regularly using the iPad outside of your home, you'd do just as well to save some money and stick with a Wi-Fi model. It's also worth noting that AT&T's 3G service might not be all it's cracked up to be, considering the complaints many iPhone 3G users have made over the years.

iPad as e-reader

The iPad marks Apple's first foray into the world of e-book readers. With Apple's iBooks app (a free download, but not included), you can browse an e-bookstore stocked with bestsellers and textbooks. At launch, the iBooks store includes content from five major publishers: HarperCollins, Hachette, Penguin, Macmillan, and Simon & Schuster.

Just as in iTunes, titles in the iBooks store are organized by popularity and by genre. Users can preview the first few pages before purchasing, and downloaded books are sent directly to the user's virtual bookshelf. Unlike most dedicated e-book readers, the iPad allows you to read books in either portrait or a landscape mode that shows two pages at once. Onscreen settings also allow you to change the size of the text, search text within the book, look up words in a built-in dictionary, and hop around using a persistent table of contents.

Now Playing: Watch this: The Apple iPad as e-book reader

Free public domain books are also available within the iBooks store, and any EPUB book format (including titles from Project Gutenberg and Google Books) can also be transferred to iPad via iTunes. Competing e-book software, such as the Amazon Kindle app, is also available on the iPad.

From a software perspective, the iPad's capability to integrate multiple e-book formats and third-party online stores makes it one of the most flexible, all-encompassing e-book readers on the market. With a 9.7-inch screen, it's also one of the largest readers we've tested, tied with Amazon's $489 Kindle DX.

One of the easiest criticisms to lay against the iPad as an e-reader is its lack of e-ink technology. There are good reasons why Sony, Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and others don't use backlit LCDs on their e-book readers: they drain battery life; fatigue the eye; and become difficult to read in direct sunlight. All of these criticisms are fair. You can read for four days on the Kindle DX without a recharge, compared with approximately 10 hours on the iPad. As on any LCD (including the one you're probably reading on right this minute), text isn't as easy on the eye as it could be with printed paper. Under bright outdoor lighting conditions, the iPad is very reflective, but fairs well in the shade. And at 1.5 pounds, the iPad is hefty for a reader, warranting a lap or a two-hand grasp for extended reading.

Seth Rosenblatt

But for all its potential pitfalls, the iPad as an e-book reader has an equal share of advantages, provided you confine yourself to reading indoors. The presentation of books on the iPad is gorgeous. Cover graphics and illustrations display in rich color, book pages have a deliberately paperlike tone, and turning pages by tapping or flipping is intuitive. Page turns also render much faster than with e-ink technology, allowing you to quickly flip through pages. Unique features, such as in-book music and video playback (when supported), and one-touch dictionary definitions further distinguish the iPad from its e-reader competitors.

Let's also not forget that there are a lot of books and periodicals that traditional e-ink readers do a poor job of presenting. For magazines, travel guides, photo essays, and graphic novels, the iPad's color screen has the upper hand. We also enjoy how the iPad's ambient-light-sensing screen provides just enough light for an in-bed read and automatically ramps up the brightness near the kitchen window. The only annoyance of reading in bed with the iPad is that lying flat on your back and holding the iPad over your head, or reading on your side, can cause the tilt-sensor to wonder if it's being held is landscape or portrait orientation. A flip of the orientation lock switch will freeze the screen orientation into position, but at the end of a long day, you tend to forget these details.

Games

Just like the iPhone and iPod Touch, third-party apps for the iPad are a big deal. Generally speaking, apps made by these developers branch off in every conceivable direction, from cooking recipe journals to Twitter clients. But if there's one type of app that rules over all the rest in both quantity and popularity, it's games.

Now Playing: Watch this: Gaming on the Apple iPad

All of the thousands games available for the iPhone and iPod Touch can be played on the iPad, scaled up to fit the screen or played at their native resolution. The more than 21,000 games account for more titles than the Sony PSP and Nintendo DS, combined. And those are the games that predate the iPad.

The handful of games we tested on the iPad included N.O.V.A. (a first-person shooter reminiscent of HALO), Igga Arcade (a bundled series of children's games), Fieldrunners (war strategy), Scrabble, and Labyrinth 2 (puzzles). In every instance, the iPad-optimized games look and feel radically different from the experience of playing on an iPhone, or even a PSP. N.O.V.A., in particular, features the kind of responsiveness, graphics, and sharp resolution we'd expect from an Xbox 360.

Unfortunately, the closer the iPad comes to delivering the kind of games we're used to seeing on traditional gaming machines, the more we hunger for practical game controls. Some games are a natural fit for the iPad's touch input and tilt-sensor, others could really benefit from a standard direction pad or joystick.

Minor complaints aside, as a portable way to stay distracted for hours at a time, the iPad's gaming capabilities and deep catalog of compatible titles will appeal to thrill seekers of all types.

iWork

Unsatisfied to leave the iPad as an entertainment and casual computing device, Apple had to go and spoil the fun by offering the iWork suite of productivity software redesigned for the iPad. Already a familiar staple on Mac computers, the iWork software suite for iPad includes three apps: Pages (word processing), Numbers (spreadsheets), and Keynote (presentations). It's the first version of the software to run on one of Apple's portable devices and makes full use of the iPad's touch screen. Each app is offered separately at $9.99 apiece.

We'll be covering the iPad's iWork apps in greater depth on CNET's Download.com. For the purposes of our iPad review, however, we think it's fair to say that the apps represent a good value, especially considering that the Mac version of the suite sells for $70. More importantly, iWork (and similar third-party apps that are sure to follow) shows how the iPad can hold its own against inexpensive Netbooks running Microsoft's tried-and-true Office software, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. In fact, iWork apps are capable of opening and editing common Office documents, though exporting options are somewhat meager. Pages documents can be saved as a Word, PDF, or Pages file. Keynote and Numbers documents can be saved only in their native format or exported as PDFs.

Capabilities aside, there are certain inherent design constraints that prevent the iPad from working gracefully as a productivity tool. The first hurdle is the keyboard. To Apple's credit, the iPad's onscreen keyboard is one of the largest and most responsive we've encountered on a tablet device. Chalk it up to an old dog's aptitude for new tricks, but when it comes to writing multiple pages of text (reports, term papers, rambling manifestos) our fingers just seem to fly faster on a real keyboard.

In response to this possible complaint, Apple's $69 keyboard dock or Bluetooth keyboard accessory can be used to give apps like Pages the kind of real keyboard they deserve. Unfortunately, once you've crossed over to a keyboard accessory, your brain might balk a little at the absence of a mouse. You're still stuck jumping around pages and making edits by reaching out and touching the display. It's an awkward disconnect that isn't impossible to power through, but isn't ideal, either.

Getting files off the iPad isn't as simple as plugging in a thumb drive or burning a CD. You either need to e-mail them, upload them to an Apple iWork.com account, or save them to a shared folder on the iPad's internal memory. You can access this shared folder by connecting the iPad to iTunes on a Mac or PC with the included cable, but if the connected computer isn't your own, it may prove impossible to grab the files.

You face a similar dilemma printing a document you've composed on the iPad--or anything else via the iPad, for that matter. We may see an elegant solution for this in time, but your best bet at the moment is e-mailing or transferring the document to a printer-equipped computer--not a good solution for printing out airline boarding passes, for instance.

Could a high school or college student get away with using an iPad as a primary computer? With the iWorks suite, a keyboard dock accessory, and a ""can do"" spirit, it's certainly possible, but a similarly priced Netbook, though not as sexy, will offer more flexibility and better typing and editing performance.

MobileMe

Apple's MobileMe service gives iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch owners a way to keep e-mail, contacts, and calendars in sync with their computers without ever having to dock the device. The service runs $99 per year (after a 60-day free trial) and also provides a Web-based photo gallery for your digital photo collection, an iDisk service for storing files remotely, a utility for locating the device if it becomes lost, and a security feature that can remotely erase the device in case of theft.

CNET has a separate review of Apple's MobileMe service, which goes into more depth. As it relates to the iPad, we think that MobileMe features such as remote wipe and location look-up are less relevant, since the product is less prone to loss than the iPhone or iPod Touch. Without a built-in camera on the iPad, the photo-hosting capabilities of MobileMe are less of a draw, as well.

For households with multiple computers and/or iPhones, MobileMe's capability to keep e-mails, contacts, and calendars updated across all your devices can be worth every penny. It's not for everyone, but for those who need it, MobileMe solves a real problem.

Accessibility features

At first glance, a touch-screen tablet may seem like a poor choice for anyone dealing with a physical impairment, but Apple's pioneering work with improving the accessibility of the iPhone and iPod brings some noteworthy enhancements to the iPad. Visually impaired users may find using Apple's Voice Over feature a functional method for navigating menus and typing messages and e-mails. As you drag your finger around the display and tap a button, the iPad will read a description of that button. The iPad will also read the text of dialog boxes, the time of day, the status and orientation of the display (locked or unlocked, portrait or landscape), and detail information, such as the battery level and Wi-Fi signals. What's more, it speaks each character as you type a message, and it will suggest autocorrection choices. Voice Over can read text messages, e-mails, and even Web pages.

To use Voice Over in accessibility mode, you will need to learn a different set of gestures--for example, you'll have to double-tap to open an item--but the feature provides audible instruction. You can set the speaking rate and choose from 21 supported languages. Voice Over works with all of the iPad's native applications, but support for third-party apps varies. Though we're sighted and our Voice Over user experience can't compare with someone who is visually impaired, we were impressed by the feature's capabilities. The iPad also adds multitouch zoom support for the Home, Unlock, and Spotlight screens for all applications, both native and third-party. Previously, zoom worked only in the photo gallery, e-mail in-boxes, and the Safari browser. You can activate the enhanced zoom in the Settings menu, but you can't use it and Voice Over simultaneously.

You also can reverse the display's contrast to white on black. Menus will show white text on a black background, and the Home screen will change to a white background. Just be aware that the contrast change alters the appearance of photos in the gallery so that they look like negatives. It has a similar effect for app icons on the Home screen.

Performance

For a product that's between $500 and $900, the iPad smokes. The custom Apple 1GHz A4 processor wields some power, which is most evident in apps that don't depend on the Web, such as photos, iBooks, or games.

Hand in hand with the processor speed is the responsiveness of the multitouch screen, which also manages to dazzle the eye with its sharp 1,024x768-pixel resolution backlit by even-toned LEDs. Screen angles are unbelievably good, thanks to the same IPS (in-plane-switching) screen technology Apple uses in its desktop displays.

Audio quality is indistinguishable from our trusty iPod Touch, offering a smooth and balanced sound, provided you pair it with quality headphones.

Apple rates the iPad at 10 hours of continuous use, including video playback. Our experience so far shows this to be a somewhat conservative estimate, especially if you're spending much of your time in less-intensive apps, such as iBooks or e-mail. We'll post a detailed breakdown of battery-drain results from CNET Labs, once testing is complete.

Final thoughts

Depending on who you talk to, the iPad is either the future of personal computing, the best distraction money can buy, or Apple's most doomed product since the Apple QuickTake digital camera. Even Apple's marketing team seems to be having a hard time nailing down exactly what the iPad is; in commercials, one minute it's a digital book, the next it's the photo album of the future.

There's nothing specific we can tell you that will justify paying $499 for the 16GB base model, much less $829 for a juiced-up 64GB version with 3G wireless. The only concrete reason to buy an Apple iPad is to be able to play around with the most celebrated gadget of the year. For CNET readers, we expect that is reason enough.",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-10155181-12.html,"Skype 4.0 for Windows delivers truer video, sound","February,Am,Jessica Dolcourt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Skype 4.0 (download) became available for free on Tuesday to Windows users. The free desktop VoIP communicator is a worthy final version that brings some key enhancements with video and audio bandwidth, though it leaves behind some of the extra adornments of version 3.8, the last stable build.

Those who have been following the triple release of betas since the summer won't see more than a few changes. If 4.0 is new to you, however, the developments are more notable.

Skype concentrates on video size, quality, and performance in this version. From version 3.8 to version 4.0, every design change has been made to draw video and IM to the forefront, and for the most part it works. The video window has expanded and calls are easier to start. The classic two-pane interface has consolidated into one, though you can still split them apart if you prefer.

(Credit: Skype)

As the culmination of the beta series, Skype 4.0 gets a pumped-up video and a completely new audio engine. Compared with other codecs out there, the new audio engine, named Silk, is touted to give Skype superwide-band audio (which operates like broadband), but uses half the bandwidth. Fewer bandwidth demands gives Skypers with dial-up connections (like a lot of people in India and Brazil) a bigger boost, keeping calls from being dropped or mangled beyond recognition.

I'll attest to the great call quality during my interview with Skype's London-based product manager. It was clear and the vocal timbre sounded true. Keep in mind that I dialed in from a newish, memory-loaded Asus computer with full broadband support and a set of top-tier headphones. Quality will still depend on your Internet connection and hardware configuration. Using headphones that support ultra-wideband audio will help.

The video stream was similarly good. Though far from the perfection of TV, I noticed fewer jumps and blips and sound syncing that was very close to real-time. Problems that have beset Skype's video calls in the past--a frozen or choppy image and packetized audio--were largely absent during test calls. According to Skype, that's thanks to a new back-end addition that sticks a finger in the air of network conditions. As available bandwidth drops, the bandwidth manager tries to salvage audio first.

In choppy conditions, it helps steady the video, too, by lowering the rate of frames per second and by compressing images more heavily. Your friend on the other end may become blocky and the image delayed, but faces should also break up less than in previous versions.

Other new features include abuse reporting if you receive an invite from an unauthorized Skyper, and a light stub installer that pulls down the rest of the application.

Skype, it seems, has also been pulled into a toolbar partnership. Now when you install it, you'll see that an optional toolbar that comes bundled with Skype 4.0. The free Browser Highlighter includes the 'Compare on eBay' tool for Firefox and Internet Explorer. Considering that eBay owns Skype, it's not a surprising addition, but one I'll nonetheless pass on every time.

What's missing

There are two skins in version 4.0, the default light gray and blue combo called Skype 'Chrome,' and the classic hue. Skype hinted at more skin support in later versions coming out this year. There aren't plans at the moment to support third-party skins, but customization, I've been assured, will get more attention.

Along these lines are absent customizations that had not been making beta testers happy. If you've been holding your breath for greater IM treatment in this release, or birthday reminders, you might breathe again until the next launch.

Those of you shouting about the cessation of public chats will be glad to know that Skype 4.0 for Windows will support those you already have, but it will keep you from adding new ones. Skype representatives told us they're still playing around with ideas of how to become more Web-oriented. It could as easily look like a reshaped version of chats as it could go in a different direction.

That brings us to Skypecasts, another source of some users' lamentations. Skypecasts was pulled last September because it just couldn't grab the hoped-for attention. A similar(-ish) feature will probably be rolled into whatever public chats becomes in future releases.

For now, Skype has retreated to its bread-and-butter position of providing good, clean voice, video, and text chatting. If worldwide Windows users notice consistently improved audio and video quality, that's not a bad place to be.",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20008495-12.html,Firefox 'Lorentz' arrives but with restrictions,"June,Pm,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Firefox 3.6.4 might not sound like a major update, but the latest version debuts an important new feature for Mozilla's browser. Code-named ""Lorentz"" and available for Windows and Linux, the update includes the highly-anticipated Out-of-Process Plug-in (OOPP) ""sandboxing"" feature that prevents specific plug-ins that crash from taking down the entire browser. In this initial implementation, OOPP will prevent Adobe Flash, Apple QuickTime, and Microsoft Silverlight crashes from causing browser-wide instability.

(Credit: Mozilla)

While Mac users do get the security fixes made in their version of Firefox 3.6.4, they won't get OOPP support. In an FAQ, Mozilla said that getting OOPP to work on the Mac version of Firefox ""requires major changes"" to the browser, and that users should expect it in the major Firefox 4 update due late this year.

OOPP has been part of Google Chrome for some time but in a slightly different form. Mozilla's version, which the publisher touts as allowing users to experience ""uninterrupted browsing,"" is slightly different in that it relates only to specific plug-ins. Plug-ins are not the same as extensions and add-ons, although some people colloquially use the terms interchangeably. A plug-in is a special kind of add-on that helps the browser perform specific functions such as media playback or viewing images that would otherwise be unviewable.

So in Firefox 3.6.4, when a plug-in crashes, only the plug-in component of the page becomes unusable. This is the same as Chrome, but Chrome differs in that its tabs are ""sandboxed"" so that if the renderer crashes one Web site, the rest of the browser will not crash. Non-OOPP crashes in Firefox will still take down the whole browser, but Mozilla expects people to see a dramatic reduction in the incidence of browser crashes because of the OOPP innovation.

OOPP also will automatically let Firefox 3.6.4 users know when plug-ins need to be updated. If you're not sure of a plug-in's status, Mozilla has created a Web site that will automatically scan your plug-ins, let you know which ones need to be updated, and provide download links for them.

For a while, it seemed like Firefox 3.6.4 might launch without the OOPP feature. A potential security risk kept the browser from hitting its original street date of early June.

The latest official update to what some are calling the largest shareware trial period ever introduces more than mere bug fixes as the operating system upgrades from beta to release candidate. The Windows 7 Release Candidate does contain several major and minor changes, but the overall experience remains largely unchanged.

What's most important to you about the release candidate will depend on your perspective. Certainly, one of the biggest new features makes Windows Media Player useful again: you can now stream media files from one Windows 7 computer to another, across the Internet and out of network. Even better, the set up procedure is dead simple.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

When you open Windows Media Player, there's a new Stream option on the toolbar. Click it and you're presented with two choices. Both require you to associate your computer with your Windows Live ID. When you've associated a second Windows 7's WMP with that same ID, you can remotely access the media on the host computer.

A less glitzy but no less important change to how removable drives are handled also can impact your media. Unlike Windows XP and Windows Vista, Windows 7 will no longer AutoRun external hard drives and USB keys when they're connected. This kills off a risky vector for malware infections that has been the bane of many security experts.

Experts and people or companies who hope to use Windows 7 for business situations will appreciate the new XP Mode. It doesn't have much of a practical application for the home consumer, but if you need to access programs designed for Windows XP that have not been upgraded to Windows Vista or 7, XP Mode creates a virtual environment within Windows 7 that should assuage any fears of upgrading without backward compatibility.

It's not easy to set up once you've downloaded the XP Mode installer. You'll need to double-check that you have the right hardware and can get the right software. Hardware Virtualization Technology, also known as AMD-V, Vanderpool, or VT-d, must be supported for it to work. Motherboards older than two years probably won't work, and even if you do have a newer one you might have to go into your BIOS and activate Hardware Virtualization. CPU-identification utilities are available from Microsoft that can tell you if you're in the clear. However, if compatibility is the issue, this hassle will be worth it to you. Users will have full access to peripherals connected to their Windows 7 hardware, including printers, and the clipboard can be used to cut and paste between the virtual operating system and the ""real"" one.

Windows 7's native search feature has been improved. Files that I added to my hard drive were indexed so fast that they were searchable less than five seconds after saving them. Search result snippets now include a longer snippet, and highlight the snippet more clearly. This should appeal specifically to people who juggle large numbers of long documents, but I don't know of anybody who wouldn't appreciate finding the file they're looking for faster.

Lacking a touchscreen laptop, I wasn't able to personally try out the enhancements made to touchscreen support. However, it now supports multitouch zooming and taskbar previews when you drag your finger across the active programs pinned to the taskbar.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Other changes stood out, too. Better Device Stage support for older devices makes one of Windows 7's best features applicable to peripherals and externals that don't need to be upgraded. Windows Media Player's mini mode looks much slicker, emphasizing the album art--sometimes at the expense of clearly seeing the controls, but it's a definite improvement. One annoying change is that Bluetooth support no longer comes baked into the operating system. If you need a Bluetooth driver, you'll either need the installation disc on hand or you'll have to download the driver.

Windows 7 continues to get better, but because this is the Release Candidate, unless Microsoft surprises us we're pretty much looking at the final feature set. If you're testing Windows 7 beta, you'll have to back up your data before upgrading to the RC, but once you do you'll be able to use it until June 1, 2010. The beta will start intentionally shutting down every two hours on July 1, 2009.

We've shot several videos at CNET TV about Windows 7. Among others, you can take a first look at the release candidate, a first look at the beta, which includes a lot of information about what you can do with Windows 7, and an explanation of how to dual-boot Windows 7 alongside your current Windows operating system.

Update May 6, 2009: Users who wish to purchase Windows 7 once the final version is released will need to do a full backup of their data and then perform a clean install of operating system. As with the update from Windows 7 beta to the RC, there will be no direct upgrade path to the final version.",html

The Acid test, for those who do not know, tests how well a browser complies with a given set of Web standards. While all three browsers pass the Acid2 test, Chrome currently clocks in at 78 out of 100 on Acid3, while Firefox and IE7 stand at 71 and 14 respectively. The only release quality build to beat Chrome is Opera, which scores an 83.

Even though Google has the stable builds edged out, we have to remember that Chrome is still in development, where it is topped by a number of other ""unstable,"" development builds, including Firefox 3.1 Beta 1 (85), Opera (91), and Safari 4 (100). It is interesting that the Safari 4 Developer Preview performs so much better than Chrome, given that they are both built on Apple's WebKit framework.

Whenever a new browser or an update to a browser is released, one of the first things that techies tend to look at is how it fares on the Acid test. The latest iteration of the test, Acid3, is the hardest yet and no ""stable"" browser builds have achieved a 100 out of 100 on the test, although the Safari 4 Developer Preview has.

Passing the Acid3 test is an important goal for browser developers and it's great to see that Chrome is performing so well on its first attempt.

Update:

A reader, Benjamin, writes in saying that under Vista SP1, Chrome shows scores ranging from 74 to 79 on the Acid3 test. Running it again right now, the test showed a score of a 79. Some of the initial variability could have been due to the servers for the Acid3 test being hammered as a result of Chrome's release.",html

It's a live Q&A service (see Quora, Answers, the departed Aardvark) about locations (see Foursquare, Facebook). If you want to know how crowded a bar or restaurant is, you pose the question on Localmind. People (but not all of them) who have checked in at that location on Foursquare get an alert and can reply to your query. Hopefully, you get your answer back quickly enough to matter.

Screenshot by Rafe Needleman/CNET

The app was launched at SxSW last year, and it's great for arenas like that; a lot of people competing for floor space, spending half their time buried in their smartphones.

Out in the real world, Localmind CEO Lenny Rachitsky says it's been a minor struggle to get people to remember to use the app. ""It's not useful all the time, so people forget about it.""

The team has been tweaking the social model since launch, trying to get ahead of that problem. First, Localmind got ""experts,"" people who would get questions about venues even if they weren't checked in there. For example, if you're an expert on a particular restaurant, even if you're home, you might get a question like ""What's the best thing to order?""

That helps for two reasons. The first, obviously, is that it makes it more likely that a user will get an answer to a question. The second is that it reminds users of the app's existence when questions pop up on their screens.

Localmind

Today, Localmind 2.0 is launching, with yet another way to spread the use case out a bit. Now you'll be able to ask questions about entire areas. What's the best place to park in North Beach? Can you recommend a restaurant for a date in the East Village? And so on.

There's ""a lot of science"" in the Localmind service, Rachitsky says. He wants to make sure that people get timely answers from users who know what they are talking about, and the social graph doesn't provide enough information for that, so Localmind has to dig deeper into response patterns of its users. But the work is paying off. Tweaking algorithms and adding the Expert feature have led to improved answer rates: from 50 percent at launch to 90 percent, Rachitsky says, and ""usually within three minutes.""

He hopes Version 2.0's Area feature will juice that even further.

Eventually, Rachitsky says, Localmind may begin to peel away from its reliance on Foursquare for location reporting. He is highly aware of the privacy issues around real-time location tracking, though, so for this new feature, he's taking it slow.

Localmind is available everywhere, but Rachitsky says its strongest user bases are in San Francisco, New York, Montreal, and Tokyo. There are versions for the iPhone and the iPad.",html

A paid upgrade to the popular torrent manager uTorrent is in the works, the makers of the program announced today.

Less than a month after the release of uTorrent 3.0 (download), the program's parent company, BitTorrent Inc., revealed plans to introduce a paid upgrade called uTorrent Plus. Though it's still in development and unavailable to the public, uTorrent Plus promises to include tools that will eliminate codec problems, convert file formats, and move content between devices, according to the blog post announcing the product.

Also in that blog post, Jordy Berson, director of product management for uTorrent, promised that the free version ""will receive the same level of commitment and development resources as it does now.""

Around 100 million people call uTorrent their preferred torrent manager. To put that number in perspective, the security suite AVG Antivirus Free claims around 110 million active users, while Google CEO Larry Page just revealed that the Chrome browser has about 160 million users.

""uTorrent Plus is designed for people who are looking for a single solution to find, get, and play content anywhere, on any device,"" Berson wrote. The price point for uTorrent Plus has not been announced, The company has also created a sign-up page for people who want more information on uTorrent Plus.",html

This week the company has been sending out e-mails and text messages to wireless subscribers who have been using their smartphones as modems to connect laptops and other devices to AT&T's wireless data network without paying the additional $20 tethering fee. Letters and text messages that have been sent to offending subscribers have been posted on various Web sites.

In short, AT&T is telling these customers to pay up or stop using their devices as modems.

""Our records show that you use this capability (tethering), but are not subscribed to our tethering plan,"" the e-mail reads. ""If you would like to continue tethering, please log into your account online at www.wireless.att.com, or call us...If you discontinue tethering, no changes to your current plan will be required. ""

If AT&T doesn't hear from the offending subscriber and he or she continues to use tethering without paying for it, the company will automatically begin charging customers for the usage, the letters indicate.

AT&T requires smartphone customers who use the tethering feature to subscribe to its 2GB data service for $25 a month and pay a $20 a month tethering fee. Customers who tether are given 4GB of data to use during the month. Customers who exceed that limit are charged $10 a GB thereafter.

""This is all part of ensuring that we can manage our network,"" said Mark Siegel, a spokesman for AT&T. ""We are simply letting customers know that we have a tethering plan in place, and we're inviting them to get on the plan.""

Siegel said that AT&T is able to detect how devices are being used. But he wouldn't explain how the company determines whether a smartphone is being used to connect to the Internet or whether it's used to provide Internet connectivity to other devices.

Siegel said the company has always been able to monitor subscribers' activity, but it has just recently begun sending notifications to a small number of customers.

""We have to be able to tell what is happening on the network to manage it properly,"" he said. ""So if someone is tethering, then they need to be on a tethering plan.""",html

Google's long-awaited cloud music service has arrived. It's called Music Beta; it's free (for now, and currently invite-only); and after giving it a test-drive, I'm happy to report that the whole system is fairly smooth.

From the perspective of the end-user, the payoff of Music Beta is to have your entire music collection in the cloud, available to stream instantly from any browser or Android-based device (phone, tablet, Google TV). Out of the box, a new Android smartphone or tablet can tap into your music collection within minutes, with no computer syncing required. That's pretty cool, and it's something that iOS users can't brag about (yet).

There is a catch, though. Unlike Amazon's Cloud Drive service (or similar online music lockers), Music Beta users can't download their collections back down to a different computer, making it a poor choice for anyone looking for a solution that will distribute their music across multiple machines. Android users can store some music temporarily in their device memory for offline listening, but permanently downloading is not an option.

Another interesting difference between Google's service and Amazon's is that one of the first setup pages for Music Beta allows you to select what genres of free music you'd like Google to seed into your collection. Since these tracks can't be downloaded back down to your computer, they're essentially streaming-only. After selecting Indie Rock and Hip-Hop from the free music genre listings, we noticed new tracks in our collection from artists such as Black Tambourine, E-40, and our personal favorite, Kriss Kross.

Earlier this morning, I sat in on a Webcast where Opera's Chief Development Officer, Christen Krogh, ran through a demo and answered questions. Opera Unite, which uses your Opera ID to log in, is a Web server housed within the Opera browser. With it, you'll be able to host a Web site, and share files, music, video, notes, and chats with others.

The sharing process begins when you select the hard drive where your files are stored, and then select the individual files you'd like to share. You'll then set your sharing preferences--either public, private, or password-protected--and Opera Unite will create a direct URL, which you can share with others. Guests can view the content from any browser, not just Opera's.

Opera Unite doesn't yet extend to mobile phones and other Opera-powered browsers, but that will eventually be part of the plan.

Security has been a concern so far. Opera Unite is as secure as Opera Widgets, Krogh said. It features native apps running in a sandbox on top of Opera's Web browser, and using local storage. CNET's sister site ZDNet UK explores the security of Opera Unite in an article.

Opera Unite shares similarities with the now-defunct AllPeers, an add-on for Mozilla's Firefox browser. While Mozilla hasn't announced intentions to build a similar sharing or hosting service, it is offering developers a chance to create more robust code packages using Mozilla Jetpack, a recent Labs project.

The technical preview version of Opera 10 is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. You should consider the software experimental; you may encounter bugs or other imperfections while using it. To see more detail about how it works, peer inside via our gallery of screenshots.

Transcript of live blog starts here:

Donald Bell/CNET

9:51 a.m. PDT: Hi everyone! Thanks for joining us. Donald and I are in and seated. We're probably 10 minutes away.

10:00 a.m.: OK, lights are dimming. Here we go.

Steve Jobs takes the stage. Note: not wearing a turtleneck. Just a black sweater.

Donald Bell/CNET

10:01 a.m.: Steve acknowledges Steve Wozniak as ""my partner in crime."" Woz stands up to lots of applause.

First up: an update of Apple retail stores.

10:02 a.m.: He's describing a new store in Paris. And their second store in China just opened in Shanghai.

Donald Bell

10:03 a.m.: Steve's showing lots of pictures of the Shanghai store. Also talking up the London store. He's spending a lot of time talking about architecture.

10:04 a.m.: Steve says there are 300 Apple stores now in 10 countries. ""We've come a long way,"" he says.

Jobs says some days more than 1 million people visit their stores, which elicits applause.

10:05 a.m.: Now iOS.

Steve says, ""touch user interfaces were completely different"" before the iPhone. Today Apple has shipped 120 million iOS devices since the original iPhone in 2007.

10:06 a.m.: ""People are throwing out a lot of numbers of how many devices they're activating per day. We're activating 230,000 iOS devices a day.""

That's new activations, he says. ""Some of our friends are counting upgrades.""

Donald Bell/CNET

200 apps every second are being downloaded, he says.

10:07 a.m.: 250,000 apps are on the store; 25,000 are made for iPad. Today, iOS 4.1 is coming.

""A lot of bugs have been fixed."" Proximity sensor, Bluetooth, iPhone 3G performance bugs are fixed.

HDR, high-dynamic range photos are coming. Standard in iOS 4.1.

Donald Bell/CNET

10:08 a.m.: HD video upload over Wi-Fi, TV show rentals, and Game Center is finally here.

10:09 a.m.: He's explaining HDR photos. Tap on the HDR on screen, and when you take a photo, it takes three in rapid succession. One normal exposure, one that's under- and one that's overexposed. It combines them to make an HDR photo. Apple keeps the normal and HDR photo in the camera roll.

10:10 a.m.: Another thing: Game Center. It's APIs for developers and an app on the phone.

For mulitplayer games, he says. You can challenge friends to games or play random people if you ""don't have any friends.""

10:11 a.m.: He's demonstrating the way you can be matched up with other players.

10:12 a.m.: A new game later this year from Epic Games is coming. Mike Capps from Epic Games is going to demonstrate it. It's their first iOS game, called ""Project Sword.""

Donald Bell/CNET

10:14 a.m.: Demo of sword battle game is mercifully over. Steve's back.

10:15 a.m.: iOS 4.1 will be ready next week for the iPhone and iPod Touch for free.

A surprise for us today, he says. A sneak peek at iOS 4.2 is coming ""a little later this year.""

It's unifying the iPad and iPhone. Everything from the iPhone is coming to iPad--including a new feature, wireless printing.

Donald Bell/CNET

10:16 a.m.: They're also adding something called ""Airplay,"" which will be explained later, he says.

You can print from a menu option on the iPad. When you're printing, the multitasking bar below will show you what jobs are printing.

10:17 a.m.: Airplay is the new name for AirTunes. You can stream audio, video, and photos over Wi-Fi to other devices.

10:18 a.m.: We're getting an iOS 4.2 demo for the iPad. He launches Pandora to play us a song while he answers e-mail, launching a browser demonstrating multitasking.

Next up: Folders. You can make folders on the iPad--just like the iPhone.

10:19 a.m.: iOS 4.2 is coming out in November, a free update for iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch.

10:20 a.m.: 275 million iPods sold, he said.

""We've never rested on our laurels, we try to improve every year. This year we've gone wild.""

Apple's announcing all new iPods. There's a new design for every model, he says.

10:21 a.m.: Biggest change in the iPod lineup ever, Steve says.

The Shuffle is up first. People missed the buttons, he says.

10:22 a.m.: The new Shuffle is a square with the old button navigation, but it's smaller than the second-gen model.

Donald Bell/CNET

Donald Bell/CNET

10:23 a.m.: It has a clip, speakable playlists like the last model, Genius mixes, and VoiceOver to tell you what song or artist you're listening to. It has 15 hours of battery.

10:23 a.m.: It comes in five colors: blue, pink, green, orange, and silver. The price is $49 for 2GB.

10:24 a.m. (Tom Krazit): CNET's David Carnoy on the old Shuffle design, from 2009: http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10193616-1.html

10:24 a.m.: Now for the Nano. They made it smaller this year, took off the clickwheel, and made it touch-based.

10:25 a.m.: It has multitouch on a tiny square screen.

The Nano now has a clip on it, too, like the Shuffle.

It has FM radio, NikePlus, a pedometer, and has 29 languages. 24-hour battery life.

10:27 a.m.: Now he's showing the icons and album art on the Nano, and demonstrating how it works.

The controls appear over album covers while a song is playing. You can swipe left and right, and hold to get back to the home screen.

Donald Bell/CNET

Donald Bell/CNET

10:29 a.m.: There's also an accelerometer, the screen will rotate if you turn it upside down, he shows us.

10:30 a.m.: The Nano comes in seven colors, including a Product Red version. $149 for 8GB, $179 for 16GB.

The iPod Touch is up now. Steve says it's the most popular iPod, surpassing the Nano.

10:31 a.m.: It's also ""the number one portable game player in the world,"" Steve says.

He's saying it outsells both Nintendo's and Sony's portable game players.

10:32 a.m.: 1.5 billion games have been downloaded to the iPod Touch, he says. What will we do next? Make it ""better."" The new one is thinner than the old one.

Donald Bell/CNET

It has, as expected, the retina display from the iPhone 4.

10:33 a.m.: Also inside: the A4 chip, 3-axis gyro, iOS 4.1 with GameCenter, and front-facing camera with FaceTime.

Plus HD video recording on the rear camera. 40 hours of battery while playing music.

10:34 a.m.: Like the iPhone, you can edit movies with the iMovie app right on the iPod Touch.

Donald Bell/CNET

There are three models: 8GB for $229, 32GB for $299, and 64GB for $399.

10:35 a.m.: All models available next week, but you can preorder today.

Now he's going to show us some new ads.

10:35 a.m. (Donald Bell): Bye bye, iPod Classic.

10:36 a.m.: We're watching typical Apple-y ads for the iPod Nano, a separate one for iPod Touch.

Donald Bell/CNET

10:37 a.m.: Ads are over. Steve's back. Now he's talking iTunes.

10:38 a.m.: 12 billion songs downloaded, 450 million TV episodes, 100 million movies, 35 million books, downloaded so far.

Donald Bell/CNET

Today Apple is launching iTunes 10.

It's also getting a new logo. ""We thought it was appropriate since iTunes will surpass sales of CDs in the U.S. It's time to ditch the CD in the logo,"" he says.

10:39 a.m.: There is a new list view feature. When looking at albums, there is a hybrid view. If you have five songs in same album, it shows you album artwork.

10:40 a.m.: One of the biggest things they focused on with this was discovery, according to Steve.

People want to know what friends are listening to, what concerts they're going to, what artists are doing. In iTunes 10, there is a new thing called Ping--a social network for music.

Donald Bell/CNET

""It's Facebook and Twitter meet iTunes.""

10:41 a.m. (Donald Bell): Sorry Last.fm.

10:41 a.m.: It's built into iTunes so you can follow friends and artists and see what music they're talking about, listening to, and downloading. Ping is a menu item in iTunes on the left-hand nav bar.

You get a custom chart of songs and albums to see the top things the people you follow are downloading.

Donald Bell/CNET

10:43 a.m.: You can follow people and be followed, he says. Most artists will say people can follow them. Regular people can allow anyone to follow them too. You have the option if you want to approve every one of your followers. You can set up a ""circle of friends"" of people you're OK with following you.

10:44 a.m. (Donald Bell): Wish this Ping thing was on the Web. Seems a chore to open iTunes for this stuff.

10:45 a.m.: There are 160 million potential followers/people you can follow out there already using iTunes, he says.

10:46 a.m.: Steve is writing on Jack Johnson's page now, as a demonstration.

10:46 a.m. (Donald Bell): Previews still seem to be 30 seconds here. (Leading up to the event, rumors suggested sample lengths would be expanded to 60 or 90 seconds long.)

10:46 a.m.: You can also preview songs and buy them right from a page where someone has shared them.

10:47 a.m.: They're now showing a short video from Lady GaGa saying hi to her new friends on Ping. Lots of air kisses from her.

10:47 a.m. (Donald Bell): Oh Gaga. Put some pants on.

10:48 a.m.: Steve has his own profile. (He's going to the Tegan and Sara concert on Friday, FYI, if anyone wants to say hi.)

At least according to his Ping page.

Donald Bell/CNET

10:49 a.m.: Ping is not just on your computer, it's also on the iPhone and iPod Touch.

There's a new button in the iTunes app for those devices. Just click Ping to launch it.

iTunes 10 is available starting today.

10:50 a.m. (Donald Bell): Go get your Ping on, folks.

10:50 a.m.: One more thing...

""One more hobby,"" actually.

Apple TV came out four years ago. We've sold a lot, but it's never been a huge hit. Neither has a competitive product, he says.

10:51 a.m.: What have we learned? A lot, he says. People want Hollywood movies and TV shows whenever they want them.

""They don't want amateur hour. They want professional content."" And they want it in HD.

10:52 a.m.: They don't want a computer on their TV, he says. Widescreen TVs are for entertainment, not another computer. ""It's a hard one for people in the computer industry to understand.""

People also don't want to manage storage, he says. And they don't want to have to sync to a computer. ""Most people don't want to have to think about what that is.""

10:53 a.m.: It's different than what other companies think, Steve says.

There's something new today: it's about a quarter of the size of the old Apple TV. It's small and black and palm-sized. Power supply is built in, there's no power brick.

10:54 a.m.: One HDMI connector and Ethernet, and Wi-Fi.

It has its own remote, uses all HD content, and everything is rental only. No purchases on Apple TV from now on.

10:55 a.m.: That eliminates the storage issue if you're renting not storing.

You can stream content from your computer if you'd like. No syncing is necessary.

10:56 a.m.: First-run HD movies cost $4.99 and are available to rent.

TV shows were too expensive, he says. Now rentals are 99 cents each.

Not all studios wanted to do this, he says. ABC and Fox signed up first.

10:57 a.m.: ""We think the rest will see the light and get on board with us.""

You can stream Netflix to the device if you're already a customer.

You can also watch anything on YouTube, and see photos from Flickr and MobileMe.

10:58 a.m.: You can see Rotten Tomatoes ratings right on screen as you're browsing for what to watch.

Donald Bell/CNET

11:00 a.m.: Now Steve is walking us through the new Apple TV demo.

11:01 a.m.: He's showing us how to select, scroll, preview, and rent a movie.

11:02 a.m.: You can select Favorite TV Shows, and it will show you unwatched episodes from each show.

11:04 a.m.: ""This is by far the best implementation of Netflix,"" says (totally unbiased) Steve.

That gets some laughs.

11:05 a.m.: Now we're seeing a demo of what you can do with photo slideshows on Apple TV.

11:06 a.m.: Airplay is coming in November. One of the things you can do with that is stream content from iOS devices to Apple TV.

While watching a movie on an iPad, a button will come up and ask you where you want to stream it to. You can pick Apple TV and the stream will instantly switch to that device.

11:07 a.m.: Content on iTunes is available in six countries so far, with more countries coming later this year.

Users didn't like the $229 price, he says. So the new price is $99.

11:08 a.m. (Donald Bell): You missed out, Boxee.

11:08 a.m.: Available in ""four weeks,"" but you can preorder it today, he says.

11:09 a.m.: He's running through the announcements so far today. Ping ""is going to be really popular, very fast,"" he predicts.

11:10 a.m. (Donald Bell): Ping. It's like Facebook, but with your credit card info.

11:11 a.m.: We started music stuff because ""we love music,"" Steve says. Even though we're more successful, that hasn't changed. So we asked one of our favorite musical artists to perform.

11:12 a.m.: Aaaand it's Coldplay.

11:12 a.m. (Donald Bell): Sweet. Cue heart-tugging piano.

11:12 a.m.: Sorry, actually it's just Chris Martin.

Donald Bell/CNET

11:13 a.m.: ""Toughest closing gig we've ever had,"" Martin says.

11:13 a.m.: The rest of the band is too busy, he says. But he'll play us one song, and maybe another one if we want more.

11:14 a.m.: He picks ""Yellow"" to perform solo for us.

11:17 a.m.: Oh we do get one more song, ""Viva La Vida."" He credits iTunes with making it a hit.

11:22 a.m.: The crowd asks for another song. ""I'm afraid I've played all the hits,"" he says.

11:22 a.m.: So a new song instead. Coldplay 2.6 is the name, he jokes.

11:23 a.m.: Actually it's called ""Wedding Bells."" It's not sure to get released, so this may be the only public playing, he says.

11:26 a.m.: Martin gets a standing ovation from the crowd after fleeing the stage rather quickly.

11:26 a.m. (Donald Bell): Bye, now. Gotta go fondle some iPods, methinks.

11:27 a.m.: Steve thanks us all for coming. That's it. Thanks for joining us today! We'll have more commentary, hands-on reviews, and analysis throughout the day, so be sure to check back.

Now Playing: Watch this: Buzz Out Loud Ep. 1299: Apple iPod announcement shuffles...

Editors' note: The original, bare-bones version of this story was posted Tuesday at 2:40 p.m. PDT.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-20009362-245.html,"Experts: Android, iPhone security different but matched",,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Google

So, which is more secure to use, the iPhone or the Android?

Neither, according to security experts who say the two fastest-growing smartphone platforms are different but comparable.

The main difference is that Apple must approve all apps distributed via the Apps Store, which is the only way to get apps on the iPhone unless it is jail broken so it can run whatever software an owner wants. Android apps are not vetted by Google or anyone prior to distribution.

Another big difference is that the Android user is informed about what data and resources an app will have access to and user permission is required before the app can be installed. Meanwhile, iPhone apps are all given the same limited default data and resource access, except for location-based information that requires special permission from the user. The reach of Android apps is more limited, generally.

(Microsoft appears to borrow a bit from both models. The company vets the apps, but also uses sandboxing technology that limits then apps' access to their own data, according to Todd Biggs, director of product management for Microsoft's Windows Phone Marketplace.)

So, in essence, Apple serves as a gatekeeper that may be helpful in keeping blatantly malicious apps out but if something malicious does sneak in it could conceivably cause more damage than if it were on an Android because it may be able to access data and resources it shouldn't have access to, experts said.

""Both sides have pluses and minuses,"" said Kevin Mahaffey, co-founder and chief technology officer of mobile security provider Lookout.

Some security researchers question Apple's ability to adequately screen apps, given there are so many being developed so quickly.

""There are thousands of apps for the iPhone, and Apple has to approve each one,"" said Charlie Miller, a principal analyst at Independent Security Evaluators. He was the first person to hack the iPhone, via a hole he found in the mobile version of Safari in 2007, and he discovered two vulnerabilities in the Android browser.

Earlier this year, Swiss researcher Nicolas Seriot complained to CNET about lax security at Apple's Apps Store after some apps were found to be harvesting user data, either intentionally or unintentionally. They were pulled from the online store.

To illustrate the threat from over reaching or rogue apps, Seriot created a proof-of-concept app called ""SpyPhone"" that used the application programming interfaces to access all sorts of data on a phone that could be used to track users and their activities.

It's unclear exactly what Apple looks for in its application certification process.

Apple representatives were not available to be interviewed for this story, however, an Apple spokeswoman provided this statement: ""Apple takes security very seriously. We have a very thorough approval process and review every app. We also check the identities of every developer and if we ever find anything malicious the developer will be removed from the iPhone developer program and their apps can be removed from the Apps Store.""

Apple assumes both the control over which apps users can download, as well as the burden for making sure the apps are safe to use. Android users have more choice in what apps to download but they also should carefully read the permissions screen that describes what the apps will do before they install them.

""The bad thing (about the Android model) is it puts some burden of security on the end user,"" Miller said. ""If I download a game and it says it wants access to GPS and the Internet, that is suspicious and I can say 'no.' But on the other hand, I don't want my sister or grandmother making security decisions. If people are just going to click 'yes,' then it doesn't do any good.""

Google

The Android Permissions Dialogue language explains clearly what an app is capable of doing on the device, said Mahaffey, who said he will present an analysis of what Android and iPhone apps are actually doing on devices at the Black Hat security conference in July. (A list of the permissions here.)

""There are risks associated with an open apps model, but there's also a lot of user benefit and the level of risk a user is exposed to depends more on the user than the platform. Users know what they are getting in the Android model,"" he said. ""In the pre-approved model, users don't have full knowledge of an application's capabilities. While there aren't any known examples of this, an approved application may download code from the Internet to add malicious behavior without a user's knowledge.""

Because Android apps are not scrutinized closely before being available for download, it's possible that misleading or dubious apps will make it onto phones. This happened recently with two proof-of-concept apps researcher Jon Oberheide of Scio Security created to test the feasibility of distributing a program that could later be used to take control of an Android device in an attack exploiting a vulnerability in the Android operating system.

The apps were not malicious, but because they misrepresented their purpose, Google asked the developer to remove them from the Android Marketplace and remotely wiped them from hundreds of phones that had installed them--the first ever use of the Android Remote Application Removal Feature.

Despite the potential for abuse from unvetted apps, Oberheide said the open Android model was still preferable to a closed apps store like with the iPhone. ""We know there can be malicious apps, therefore the security model is being adapted under those assumptions,"" he said.

Beyond any potential threat from rogue apps, both iPhones and Androids are susceptible to Web-based malware that might be written to exploit a vulnerability in the software, just as any Internet-connected device is.

To some, however, the threats may be more hype than reality, at least for now.

""We've seen exploits on all platforms but haven't seen them used on any platform yet,"" said Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at security firm F-Secure. (Asked which was more secure between Android and iPhone, he replied iPhone ""because of the Apps Store"" approval process. However, later he said that programs like FlexiSpy, which purport to be one thing but are used for another after install, point to a potential weakness in the Apple Apps Store model.)

""Security concerns are mostly theoretical, at this point,"" Miller said. ""You are more likely to lose the phone"" than get hit by malware.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20069789-1/samsung-chromebook-is-interesting-but-incomplete/,Samsung Chromebook is interesting but incomplete,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Now Playing: Watch this: Samsung Series 5 Chromebook

For anybody who loves tech and gadgets, it's not hard to see the appeal of the Samsung Series 5 Chromebook. It's a small, good-looking, affordable laptop the whole purpose of which is to keep you connected to your life online. It's even more attractive to those of us who have stopped using programs like Microsoft Office in favor of Web-based apps like Google Docs and Gmail. Add in the promise of all-day battery life (all workday, that is), built-in security, invisible OS and app updates, and instant-on performance and it all sounds pretty good.

Even turning the Series 5 on for the first time was cool. Open the lid and the screen lights up. The start-up process is nearly as brief: connect to Wi-Fi, accept the OS terms, sign in to your Google account or create a new one, pick an image to associate with your account or shoot one with the Webcam, and you're done.

There's a brief touch-pad tutorial, but that's it and you're ready to start using the Web. Since everything is Web-based there is a refreshing lack of bloatware. Clicking the Home button in the browser brings you right to your collection of Chrome Web apps, which are just bookmarks to sites. The experience is actually enjoyable, especially if you already have a Google account set up. Because everything is synced, your stuff just shows up.

Should someone else want to use your Series 5, you just log out and that person can either work as a guest or sign in with his or her own Google account. Users can be removed as easily as they're added, too, so there's never any fear of someone else looking at your personal files or sites.

After a little use, though, the Chromebook's shine starts to wear off. For us it started when we needed to open a ZIP file and were greeted with an unsupported file format error. That left us searching for a Web site that would open compressed files. Something that on a Windows or Mac system takes a couple of seconds to do, on a Chromebook requires finding a site, uploading the file, waiting for the file to be processed, and then downloading the file. We then needed to edit a photo, which yet again required uploading to a site, waiting for the photo to be processed, editing the photo, and downloading it from the site.

And then there's the issue of needing an Internet connection for just about everything. Yes, there are offline apps in the Chrome Web Store, but many of them are games (bad ones at that). As of right now, Google Docs is online only and other options like Zoho Writer need the unsupported Google Gears to work offline.

So what happens if you lose your Internet connection in the middle of working in Google Docs? Well, nothing, really. As long as you don't close the tab you're on, you probably won't lose your work. As soon as you regain a connection it will automatically save. Still, you won't be able to keep working while offline. Part of this is solved with a Verizon 3G mobile broadband service included with the $499 Series 5 (the Wi-Fi-only version is $429). You get 100MB a month of data service included for two years. You can also get unlimited access for $9.99 a day or 1GB for $20, 3GB for $35, or 5GB for $50 a month.

Talking solely about the hardware, the Series 5 is a nice little Netbook. Thin, reasonably lightweight, and attractive, it's no better or worse than most Netbooks we've tested. Powered by an Intel dual-core Atom processor and backed by 2GB of memory, integrated graphics, and a 16GB solid-state drive (SSD), the system does what it's designed to do.

There's an SD card slot in front, a USB 2.0 port on each side, a VGA port for connecting to an external display or projector (though it requires a dongle), and a headphone/mic jack. There's no Bluetooth for connecting a wireless headset for voice or video chat. The Series 5 measures up well against its Acer competitor; the Acer has an HDMI output, but no SD card slot.

The Series 5 also has a slightly larger, higher-resolution screen than the Acer. Samsung's 12.1-inch wide-screen LCD offers a 1,280x800-pixel native resolution. It's a matte screen, so there are no distracting reflections when working in bright lighting or outdoors. However, off-angle viewing is pretty bad; you'll need to be sitting directly in front of the screen with it tilted just right to get a solid picture. The screen is very bright--as promised--but it also automatically adjusts brightness; that's great if you're completely stationary, but less so if you're commuting on a bus with changing light conditions.

The keyboard is large and comfortable with dedicated keys for Web navigation. Instead of a Caps Lock key, for example, there's a Search key; there are also keys for paging forward and backward, refreshing, going full-screen, and switching browser windows. We wouldn't mind having a Home key, too, to take you to the main apps page, but all in all it's a good layout. The touch pad is equally nice.

As for performance and battery life, we're still testing those things and we'll have a full review once those tests are complete. We can say that battery life is impressive so far and, as promised, the Series 5 boots remarkably quickly and resumes near instantly.

We had no problems streaming music (the speakers sound really good for the Series 5's size) and YouTube clips played fine, too. On the other hand, we tried playing some HD clips shot with a minicamcorder and, well, let's just say it didn't go well. Also, there's currently no support for Netflix streaming (it's in the works), which is a big negative for us, and Hulu streaming resulted in out-of-sync video and audio. We suspect the more sites we visit, the more slowdowns and roadblocks we'll hit, just as you would with any Netbook. Being limited to one browser doesn't help, either.

Worth noting, too, is that currently the only file systems supported are Fat32, Ext2, and Ext3, and the Series 5 doesn't seem to recognize anything larger than 1TB. If you were thinking you'd connect to network-attached storage, you can't.

We keep seeing people comment that the Samsung Series 5 or any other Chromebook will be a good choice for nontechie people. Maybe eventually, but today there are just too many holes in the experience. Plus, trying to explain to nontechies that everything they do is now online and asking them to trust that it'll be there whenever they log in might be not be that easy. Forget about explaining things like not being able to connect the Series 5 directly to a printer.

In the end, there are a lot of things you can do with a Windows or Mac laptop (or an Android tablet or iPad), but right now there are just a lot of things you can't do with a Chromebook.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-10101582-83.html,Microsoft to offer free consumer security suite,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Updated at 6:15 p.m. PST with Microsoft and McAfee comment, at 5:30 p.m. with Sophos comment, and at 4:40 p.m. with customer comment.

Microsoft

Microsoft on Tuesday said it is changing its strategy for offering PC antivirus software, with plans to discontinue its subscription-based consumer security suite and instead offer individuals free software to protect their PCs.

Code-named Morro, the new offering will be available in the second half of 2009 and will protect against viruses, spyware, rootkits, and Trojans, the company said in a statement.

With the arrival of Morro, Microsoft plans to stop selling the Windows Live OneCare service, although the two services are not identical. Morro lacks OneCare's non-security features, such as printer sharing and automated PC tuneup. Morro will, however, use fewer resources than the subscription-based offering, making it better suited to low-bandwith systems and less powerful PCs.

Microsoft decided to switch to a free product because there are still so many PCs out there that lack any antivirus software.

""Because they're not concerned about malware, the number of people who don't have antivirus software or don't keep it up to date exceeds 50 percent in developed markets, and it's worse in emerging markets,"" Amy Barzdukas, senior director of product management for the Online Services and Windows Division at Microsoft, said in an interview. ""Live OneCare was tailored for developed markets with broadband...and it's not meeting the needs of a lot of customers.""

Asked why the company wouldn't just offer both the free and subscription versions, Barzdukas said: ""Having core anti-malware at no charge for consumers, we believe, we will protect more consumers that way."" Consumers who want more than the features Morro will offer have ""fine alternatives from third parties"" to buy, she added.

Despite the fact that McAfee stands to lose paying customers to Microsoft's new free software, McAfee spokesman Joris Evers said the news signaled a defeat for Microsoft.

""Consumers have voted; OneCare, in its two years on the market, has achieved less than 2 percent market share,"" he said in an interview. ""Microsoft is giving up and has defaulted to a dressed-down freeware model that does not meet consumer security needs. This is good news for McAfee.""

Barzdukas dismissed the notion that Microsoft was responding to market share or competitive pressures. ""If the current approach isn't working... (as far as protecting consumers broadly) we need to go with a new approach,"" she said.

Asked if Microsoft would ever consider bundling the security features into Windows, Barzdukas said: ""I can't foresee such a time.""

Representatives from Symantec could not be reached for comment Tuesday.

Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos, said the news doesn't impact his security firm because it focuses on the enterprise market.

""I think this announcement may cause some sleepless nights for the chiefs at McAfee and Symantec--they've always done well out of the consumer anti-virus market, and with tougher financial times ahead of them (they) won't be pleased to see the possibility of that evaporating further,"" he wrote in an e-mail response to questions.

Microsoft had been selling Windows Live OneCare for $49.95 per year, which covered up to three PCs and offered centralized backup and optimization features in addition to security capabilities.

Windows Live OneCare will continue to be sold for Windows XP and Vista via retailers through June 30, 2009, and direct sales will be gradually phased out as Morro becomes available. ""Microsoft will ensure that all current customers remain protected through the life of their subscriptions,"" the statement said.

Morro, which will be available for download over the Internet, will work on Windows XP, Windows Vista, and the upcoming Windows 7.

The news frustrated OneCare customer Cas Purdy who complained on Facebook: ""I just paid for OneCare. I'm kind of bitter.""

Purdy, who heads up public relations at security firm Websense, said in a follow-up phone interview that he paid for his OneCare subscription a few weeks ago for his home laptop. Websense does not compete with Microsoft on consumer software.

""I'm all for a free tool but given that I just paid for it...we'll see,"" he added.

Microsoft's Barzdukas said customers should contact customer support if they have a concern. ""We will absolutely do the right thing by our customers, and if the customer wants to call our free phone support line we'll make sure they are happy,"" she said.

A posting on the Windows Live OneCare Team Blog has a detailed FAQ for customers.

Microsoft started selling OneCare in May 2006, three years after signaling its intent to enter the security software market with its purchase of Romania's GeCad.

Although OneCare received only mixed reviews, it significantly shook up the security software market, resulting in generally lower prices.

The software maker has also started selling its Forefront line of security software for businesses and indicated at its Microsoft Online launch on Monday that it plans to expand its lineup of hosted security services.

http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20022735-12.html,Will RockMelt sock it to Flock?,"November,Pm,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"While the Big Five browsers duke it out to see which one can come up with the best mix of speed, compatibility, and add-ons, social networking bruisers Flock 3 (Windows only) and RockMelt beta (Windows | Mac) have taken off the kid gloves to beat each other senseless over Twitter and Facebook integration.

This isn't a fair match by a long shot. Chromium-fueled Flock 3 has been available since June 2010, and claims 500,000 users. (Just as a point of comparison, the Mozilla Gecko-powered version 2 of Flock has 8.5 million users and has been on the market for three years.) Flock CEO Shawn Hardin pointed out that Flock version 2.6 is the most popular nonmobile app on Facebook, and Flock version 3 is the sixth most popular nonmobile app on Facebook. Just by virtue of the time that Flock has had the market practically to itself could prove a difficult hill for RockMelt to climb.

CNET has learned from a Flock representative that the company plans for a major update on December 1. The Mac version of Flock 3 is expected to debut, several months off its original due date in July 2010. LinkedIn support will be added, and the release will upgrade Flock 3 to the Chromium 7 base, which will patch numerous security holes, make bug fixes, and introduce Chromium 7's faster browsing speeds to Flock.

Currently, both Flock 3 and RockMelt 0.8.34.833 beta are built on Chromium 6.

User numbers aside, RockMelt plays David handily against Flock's Goliath. First off is the login procedure. RockMelt access is based on your Facebook login. You download it, you use your existing Facebook username and password, and you're ready to get your social on. Flock doesn't require you to create a new Flock account, although you have to be able to synchronize your data across computers. Both browsers synchronize your data to the cloud, so there's no hassle to use either one on multiple computers, but RockMelt wins this round for cutting out the registration process.

However, RockMelt is currently restricted by invitation. The browser offers a simple sharing method to help you distribute the invites allocated to you among your Twitter followers and Facebook friends, but that undercuts the otherwise fast registration process.

Supported accounts are a major area of contention. RockMelt only supports Facebook and Twitter, while Flock 3 works with both of those plus YouTube and Flickr. Supporting accounts is not enough for these browsers, which are basically Google Chrome with souped-up social networking extensions. How the accounts and their features are exposed is immensely important, with the major difference being that RockMelt maintains a single-serving update of one friend per service at time, while Flock creates a unified stream of all supported services.

RockMelt emphasizes its connection to Facebook. The ""Friends Edge"" on the left is dedicated to your Facebook friends, showing who's online, filterable by favorites, and a Show All Friends button. The right sidebar, the ""App Edge,"" is where you can toggle social networks, providing one-click access to your Facebook news feed, your Facebook profile, and your Twitter account. An indicator will tell you when you've got new updates. Chrome extensions that you install will also live here, although they don't always work. The search box has been improved, too, with hooks into your Facebook friends' lists.

RockMelt has tweaked the RSS feed subscription process into a more obvious notification. When you land on a page with an RSS feed, the browser will autodetect it and provide a one-click button for subscribing from the App Edge.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

It's undeniable that RockMelt has polish that Flock lacks. The edges utilize the mobile-app style rounded-box icons and real-time update indicators. Flock's sidebar doesn't work well when narrowed down because you lose access to the filtering features at the top and it cuts off status updates. You can hide it with a toggle on the right side of the browser, but then you must actively reopen it to see what's going on.

While those are solid hits from RockMelt, Flock's overall feature set is far more robust. You can edit your contacts, merging contact info and creating groups to organize them. These groups can then be applied to your contact stream, which lives in the right sidebar. RockMelt allows you to ""favorite"" friends in the Friends Edge, but it doesn't support the powerful sorting that Flock has. Where RockMelt only searches for Facebook contacts, Flock will search all of its supported services for your friends' updates from the location bar. Both browsers do allow you to share currently viewing sites to supported services with comments, a key feature.

So which one is best? That still depends on what you're looking to get out of the browser. Because of the tight integration with your friends and the slick design, RockMelt will give you the strongest Facebook experience of the two browsers. Since Twitter searches aren't supported from the location bar in RockMelt, along with the support for grouping and other social networking services in Flock, Flock is the better browser for a cross-discipline, unified social affair. And as noted, Mac users will have to wait until the OS X version of Flock 3 comes out.",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20069460-12.html,ZoneAlarm reboots home security suites,"June,Am,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Armed with some strong test results and new features, ZoneAlarm's latest consumer security suite revamp released today is a solid effort to attract new users and retain older fans. Available exclusively from CNET Download.com today, ZoneAlarm has updated its four main consumer options for download: ZoneAlarm Extreme Security, ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite, ZoneAlarm AntiVirus + Firewall, and ZoneAlarm Pro Firewall to feature a new unified look, more-effective threat scans, and some interesting value-added features for users who don't mind paying more to get ancillary security features.

(Credit: CheckPoint Inc.)

The interface is the most apparent change to the suites, ditching a layout that was based on multiple workflows to reach a single feature and an eye-straining font size for something that looks more generic but is also more accessible. The new interface opens to a blue-and-gray window split into three large sections in the Extreme Security suite, revealing your security statuses for your Computer, Internet, and Identity. Click one to drill deeper into your settings, or to fix problems. In the lower-end versions of ZoneAlarm, there are simply fewer options.

ZoneAlarm Pro Firewall, of course, is a souped-up version of ZoneAlarm's free firewall, so it doesn't offer any antivirus protections. The core detection engine is new and identical across the three versions that do have antivirus protection. CheckPoint, the publisher of ZoneAlarm, licenses its antivirus engine from Kaspersky but says it offers better protection than the Russian security vendor does on its own. ""We've tied it to the ZoneAlarm cloud, which we've been actively using since 2003,"" said John Gable, director of product marketing for CheckPoint.

For some, that's a hard argument to take, although if you love the ZoneAlarm firewall, it may make more sense now to invest in the ZoneAlarm antivirus protection that it comes from such a well-renowned pedigree. One of the major differences that CheckPoint built on top of the Kaspersky engine is how the suite handles what Gable called ""security events."" ""ZoneAlarm will allow you to easily roll back changes in case it's a false positive,"" said Gable. Also new this year, ZoneAlarm now runs a prescan during the installation process to clean the machine before the install takes effect.

Other changes appear in the value-added features. For one thing, all users who buy a license to a 2012 ZoneAlarm product get a license to its new parental control Facebook program SocialGuard for free. SocialGuard doesn't come with the security suites as a mandatory install; instead, you can download it only if you want to use it. Also on the parental control front, more-traditional parental controls come baked into ZoneAlarm Internet Security and Extreme Security, licensed from NetNanny.

(Credit: CheckPoint Inc.)

Another value-added feature shows up only in the Extreme Security version. It comes with the CheckPoint product DataLock, originally released in March 2010. DataLock works like TrueCrypt to encrypt your entire hard drive. One of its biggest differences from that open-source freeware is that it comes with an optional 24-7 password recovery service. Without it, forgetting the password would render the hard drive inaccessible.

If you purchase a less-robust version of ZoneAlarm, you can upgrade easily by clicking on one of the grayed-out features. That will take you to a Web page explaining the feature, with an additional link to upgrade.

A three-computer license for ZoneAlarm Extreme Security retails for $79.95, with a 30-day trial. ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite retails for $10 cheaper at $69.95, and ZoneAlarm Antivirus+Firewall and ZoneAlarm Pro Firewall are priced the same at $59.95, even though one comes with antivirus protection and the other doesn't.",html

Mozilla's Social API has activated in Firefox Beta today with its first partner, Facebook Messenger. The innovation has the potential to forever alter how browsers interact with social-networking sites, but the project is still in its infancy.

The Social API (turn it on here: Firefox Beta or Firefox Aurora) looks at the problem of how to integrate modern social networking into the browser, Johnathan Nightingale, Mozilla's director of Firefox Engineering, said during a phone conversation with CNET. ""People don't use social like they use other parts of the Web. It's not task based; it's something that pervades that you're constantly touching throughout the day. People put it in an app tab, or keep it on their phone, constantly glancing back at it.""

To that end, the Social API creates a framework that allows social-networking services to integrate more thoroughly with the browser. It requires the browser to support the API, which currently is limited to Firefox, but it also requires the social-networking service to implement the API on its end.

""We wanted to make the experience first-class in Firefox,"" Nightingale said. ""We felt that social had to be integrated differently. We wanted to create an API where your social provider could provide a few details, and then you're hooked in.""

The Facebook Messenger integration makes a few changes to the browser (download Firefox Beta for Windows, Mac, and Linux) that Facebook addicts will appreciate. It adds a persistent sidebar that streams status updates and shows Messenger availability from friends, which you can hide at will. It also adds four buttons to the right of the location bar, which make it easy to open a new tab with Facebook, to see new friend requests, to see all messages, and to manage notifications. Finally, it makes it easy to ""like"" a page by placing a Like button in the location bar.

Mozilla was quick to point out that the Social API is respectful of privacy, or at least as respectful as the service it's connecting to. The social features are opt-in, even when you visit a social-networking site. They're not turned on until the user activates them, and even then the URLs that power the sharing and feature buttons are served over secure HTTP. According to Mozilla, cookies and other data are not shared any more than without the Social API activated. Activating the Social API has the same effect as signing into Facebook itself, Mozilla said.

The location bar ""recommend"" button manifests with Facebook as the Like button. This has the benefit of allowing you to more easily Like pages that don't have embedded buttons, and it currently only sends the page's URL to Facebook. However, in the future, it could include pictures, the page title, or Open Graph tags.

Of course, Facebook, Google, and other social-networking sites track what sites are visited even when you're not logged in. They may not know that it's you specifically visiting a site, but they do see how many people are visiting sites that have their social buttons embedded. It's possible that they could cross-reference that with the people who have the Social API activated.

Mozilla did note, though, that no additional browsing data is sent to its servers.

More social-networking services are in the cards for the Social API, but not immediately, Nightingale said. ""Before we start shipping a bunch of providers, we wanted to create a solution that's really elegant,"" he said.

One of the big problems will be figuring out how to give social networks equal space in your browser, and the solution may mean that the user configures which networks get precedence. Personally, I use Google+, Facebook, and Twitter regularly, but that doesn't mean that I want each one to get equal weight in the browser interface.

Nightingale anticipates a positive reaction from the developer community, too. ""One of the things we're really keen to see is where people take it from there,"" he said. ""We have ideas, but we know that when we launch a feature like this that it's an API people can take to some exciting places.""",html

During the summer months, I like to take my dog for a walk and listen to a few innings of the Cincinnati Reds on the MLB.com At Bat app. Because my iPhone clings to the weakening Wi-Fi signal in my house as I walk down the street, I have to wait about a half a block before my iPhone drops the Wi-Fi connection and I can begin listening to the voice of the Reds, Marty Brennaman.

With iOS 9 and Wi-Fi Assist, my iPhone gives up the Wi-Fi ghost earlier and I get to Marty's call a half a block earlier. Instead of hanging on to the bitter end, Wi-Fi Assist will tell your iPhone to switch over to a cellular connection when it deems Wi-Fi connectivity to be poor. It's a seamless and effective way to drop a weak-to-the-point-of-being-useless Wi-Fi signal.

To enable Wi-Fi Assist, head to Settings > Cellular and scroll down to the bottom of the page where you'll see Wi-Fi Assist. The setting should be enabled by default, but tap the toggle switch to turn it on if it's not.

Late Monday, Opera (and Apple) proved doubters and naysayers--like me--wrong when Apple approved Opera Mini for iPhone.

Apple's acceptance of a Web browser app may not seem like a big to-do, until one looks at Apple's notoriously stringent interpretation of the rules it created to keep competing software off the iPhone. Mobile Web browsers that compete with the iPhone's Safari browser do exist, but they're all based on the same WebKit browser engine used to power Safari. In contrast, Opera has coded Opera Mini using a combination of programming languages, without adopting WebKit. Apple has certainly denied apps for less.

A loophole

At the CTIA conference in March, Opera's founder and former CEO Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner told CNET that Opera stood a strong chance of getting Opera Mini accepted into the App Store through a loophole. Unlike many Web browsers, Opera Mini doesn't technically request and load Web pages through its native code. Instead, Opera Mini is a proxy Web browser because it sends Web page requests to Opera's servers, which then compress the Web page before sending it back to the phone. The result is not only an often-faster way to distribute Web content, but also a legitimate way to bypass Apple's objection to most standalone HTML browsers.

The appearance of Opera Mini on the App Store gives iPhone users another significant browser choice based on a completely different Web engine, and one that happens to be noticeably faster than Safari in our tests. Of course, we're holding out our final opinion for a real-world test, but Opera's capability to compress Web page data bodes well for triumph in browser speed tests on iPhone. We'd expect to see makers of other proxy browsers, such as like Skyfire, follow suit and submit versions of their apps for iPhone.

Opera Mini will be available for free within 24 hours depending on your country of residence. At the time of writing, Opera Mini for iPhone was not available on iTunes or on our San Francisco-based iPhone. According to Opera, the will be available in Japan first and its availablity is continuing eastward.

It brings Google Instant to the popular toolbar, along with more robust privacy options and a cleaner interface.

Although the support for Google Instant search is the most notable feature improvement in version 7, what appears most interesting is the way that the toolbar lets you know that features like Instant, which require tracking to work, actually do track you. While this might not be news to some, it's a strong reminder that many of the data-rich features that people love do come at a cost to personal privacy.

Enabling the features is easy. After installation, which unfortunately requires a reboot of all your open browsers, the toolbar walks you through activating Instant and opens a tab with Google's toolbar tutorial video. If you choose to install without activating Instant, you can do it later by going to the Options menu. The Option menu is now accessible from the Wrench icon, just as it is in Chrome. The Options menu is also where you can toggle privacy features after installing, under the Privacy tab. A new hot-key combo, Alt+G, will jump you directly into the toolbar's search box.

For people who want to have a different default search engine in Internet Explorer, this can be a clever way to have two search engines accessible directly from the keyboard.

Along with the Wrench icon, much of the toolbar's look has been tweaked to make it look more like Chrome. App icons are identical to those used for Chrome extensions, and the vertical tab choices in the Options menu also resemble the current Chrome menu.

One excellent feature in Internet Explorer 9 is that it tells you what kind of performance impact your add-ons have on the browser. My installation of Google Toolbar 7 impacted browser start time by zero seconds, according to IE's add-on management window. That is a massive improvement for a toolbar's reputation, when most are notorious for slowing down the browser launch.

It's important to note that the Internet Explorer Google Toolbar installer will also install the Google Toolbar for Firefox. You must later go into Firefox and disable it, if you only want it in one browser.",html

Without the right tools, you can't block intruders -- you may not even know they're there. The good news: browser security tools are simple, and many are free. Read on to find out how to lock down Chrome and Firefox, check for encrypted sites, and practice safer browsing.

Google Chrome settings

Make the following three tweaks for a more secure Chrome experience.

1. Stop Chrome from storing your passwords on work devices. We advise against using Chrome to save passwords on your work computer or phone, because Chrome saves passwords in plain text (not encrypted). If someone gains unauthorized access to your device and knows where to look, they can get your passwords. Instead, we highly recommend using a password manager like Dashlane, Blur, LastPass, or KeePass, because they create passwords that are very difficult to crack. (Check out our roundup of password managers, and read about what to look for.)

To tell Chrome to stop asking if you want to save a password, click the button in the upper right-hand corner with three horizontal lines on it, then click Settings. In the window that pops up, click the Advanced Settings link at the bottom, scroll down to the section labeled ""Passwords and forms"" and uncheck the box next to ""Offer to save your Web passwords."" Chrome will save this change automatically.

2. Separate your personal and business accounts. If you're using a device provided by your employer, they may have created a corporate Google account for you, which you want to keep separate from your personal bookmarks, documents, and other cloud data.

To do that, open Chrome, go to Google.com, and click the Sign In button in the upper-right hand corner (if you aren't signed in already). Enter your work email address, click the Next button, enter the password for that account, and click Sign In. If your employer hasn't introduced additional security checks, you should be redirected to Google's search page, and now your work account name appears in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Click that name and select Add Account. Enter your personal Gmail email address and password this time. This account is added to the list that's associated with this browser, and you can swap between the two by clicking your account name in that corner.

Keep in mind that the account-name menu only shows up when you are on one of Google's sites. Alternatively, you can use a different browser like Firefox or Opera for your personal accounts, assuming your employer lets you install additional software on company-owned devices.

3. Adjust privacy settings. At the bottom of the Settings window, click Show Advanced Settings and look at the Privacy section. If you have enabled the prediction service, it will send whatever you type to Google's servers. Disable that for better privacy. Next, the setting labeled Enable Phishing and Malware Protection should be enabled by default. If that box is unchecked, we recommend re-checking it, unless this is a work device and your IT department has instructed otherwise. Finally, disabling Autofill can make its saved information unavailable to someone else if your device gets lost or stolen.

Mozilla Firefox settings

Unlike Chrome, Firefox encrypts your passwords, and you can set a master password that must be entered to access any passwords you've told Firefox to save. Check the following settings.

1. Set a master password. At the top right of your browser window, click the button with three lines on it. Click the button, the gear icon labeled Options, and then the Security tab on the left-hand side of the screen. If you've been telling Firefox to remember your passwords for various websites, you can enable a master password here that will protect your list of passwords from someone who's gained unauthorized access to your device.

2. Clear passwords. In the same menu, you can click the Saved Passwords button and tell Firefox to forget specific passwords or all of them.

3. Set up Sync for password management anywhere. Sync is Firefox's online password service that behaves like LastPass. Unlike Firefox's default password management, you can log into Sync (or LastPass) from any computer with an Internet connection to access your passwords.

Encrypted Web connections

When you go to your bank's website, a padlock usually shows up in your browser's address bar. That means the website uses an encrypted connection, which basically works like a private tunnel between the site and your computer. Some websites have optional encryption: you have to manually enter ""HTTPS"" at the beginning of the URL, or the site will default to unencrypted HTTP. However, you can get a browser extension called HTTPS Everywhere for Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Firefox for Android. HTTPS Everywhere forces addresses to default to HTTPS, if it's available for that site. Sometimes the forced encryption isn't very good -- Chrome and Firefox usually warn you if that's the case. When that happens, the most prudent course of action is to treat the website as through it's not encrypted at all -- meaning, be careful with your personal information.

You can also use a virtual private network, which creates a private tunnel that even your Internet service provider can't snoop on. Responsible, high-quality personal VPN providers charge for access as a rule, but you can lower your total cost by choosing an annual subscription over a monthly one. Check our guide for choosing a VPN and our shortlist of premium VPN providers.

Cleaning up spyware

If you install sketchy software -- like password crackers, product-key generators, or some network-penetration tools -- malicious or undesirable code may integrate into your browser. Some legit-looking programs also sneak spyware onto your PC during the installation process. For example, some browser toolbars appear harmless but secretly track all the websites that you visit. Even if you're running antivirus software that constantly guards your activities, it's a good idea to do a manual malware scan of your computer. Some malware targets and disables specific antivirus software, and antivirus apps may not search for all the threats that an antimalware app scans for. So an antimalware app is an excellent second line of defense . Popular choices include Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, Spybot Search & Destroy, and Trend Micro HijackThis.

Ad blockers

Some ad banners are avenues to getting malicious code on your computer, so a content filter like Ghostery, AdBlock, or Adblock Plus isn't a bad idea. But websites need ads to keep the property running, so if you find the content useful, add the website to your content filter's whitelist. Most apps will let you do that with a few clicks.

If you want to see the scale of browser makers' ambition to remake not just the Web but computing itself, look no farther than a new 3D technology called WebGL.

The WebGL vision is simple. You're running around in a video game universe, blasting radioactive aliens--but you got there by visiting a Web site, not by installing the game on your PC.

This sort of computationally demanding chore contrasts sharply to with today's Web, whose top-notch programmers strain to reproduce bare-bones versions of the rich capabilities open to applications running natively on a computer.

WebGL, while only a nascent attempt to catch up, is real. WebGL now is a draft standard for bringing hardware-accelerated 3D graphics to the Web. It got its start with Firefox backer Mozilla and the Khronos Group, which oversees the OpenGL graphics interface, but now the programmers behind browsers from Apple, Google, and Opera Software are also involved.

Perhaps more significant than formal standards work, though, is WebGL support in three precursors of today's browsers--Minefield for Mozilla's Firefox, WebKit for Apple's Safari, and Chromium for Google's Chrome. Opera has started implementing WebGL, too, said Tim Johansson, Opera's lead graphics developer.

With a little tinkering--check the instructions and caveats below--you can give it a whirl, too. Overall, I was favorably impressed with the technology.

CNET News Poll Will you use WebGL?

Browser makers are building 3D technology into their products. Will you use it? Yes, bring on the 3D Web

I'll stick with Flash graphics

Skip it. Direct3D is the way to go

Its performance certainly isn't enough for a competitive first-person shooter, but it's approaching utility for casual gaming. And because of how WebGL elements can be integrated with the rest of a Web site's code, it's got some advantages.

What is WebGL?

WebGL is one of a handful of efforts under way to boost the processing power available to Web applications. It marries two existing technologies.

First is JavaScript, the programming language widely used to give Web pages intelligence and interactivity. Although JavaScript performance is improving relatively quickly these days in many browsers, programs written in the language are relatively pokey and limited compared with those that run natively on a computer.

Second is OpenGL ES, a 2D and 3D graphics interface for devices such as phones or car navigation systems with limited horsepower. If a computer's graphics system has an OpenGL driver, software written to use OpenGL can tap directly into the graphics system's hardware acceleration.

WebGL links these two so JavaScript programs can call upon 3D abilities, with the HTML5 technology also under development acting as glue.

However, although OpenGL is a reasonably well established technology in graphics circles, it's a different beast for most JavaScript programmers. That means that just building support for WebGL into browsers isn't enough to establish the technology; programmers also must learn WebGL.

""WebGL is a very low-level API [application programming interface], so it's not for the faint of heart. OpenGL's shading language, GLSL, is itself an entire programming environment. So doing even simple things in WebGL takes a lot of code,"" said WebKit programmer Chris Marrin in a blog post.

How to try it

The Khronos WebGL demo page offers several pages to kick the WebGL tires. But first you'll have to get WebGL working.

First, you'll need to install the test versions of the browsers that become Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. Follow the links to download the nightly build of Safari's precursor, WebKit or the nightly ""Minefield"" build for Firefox. For those who want to use Chrome's precursor, Chromium comes in flavors for Windows, Mac OS X, 64-bit Linux and 32-bit Linux.

Screenshot by Stephen Shankland/CNET

Once you've got one of these browsers installed--and be warned that these works in progress aren't fully tested or supported--you'll have some tweaking to do, because in none of them is WebGL enabled by default.

I found it easiest to install it on Minefield, the only one of the three with a point-and-click-friendly method. In the address bar, type ""about:config"" and click through the ""I'll be careful"" warning that you're meddling with the browser's innards. In the ""Filter"" box, enter ""WebGL"" and search for an item named ""enabled_for_all_sites."" By default, its value is false right now; double-click it to make switch it to true.

For Safari on Mac OS X, open the Terminal application (it's in the Applications/Utilities folder) to get yourself a command line. Type this: ""defaults write com.apple.Safari WebKitWebGLEnabled -bool YES"" then hit return and restart WebKit. (Note that it's got the same icon as Safari, but with a gold rim around the compass.)

For Chromium, you'll have to use a command-line switch, too. On Windows, first locate the Chromium icon in the Start Menu and right-click on it. In the ""target"" field you should see the full location of the file; it's ""C:\Documents and Settings\stephens\Local Settings\Application Data\Chromium\Application\chrome.exe"" in my case. Add ""--no-sandbox --enable-webgl"" to the end of the address, outside the quotation marks. Save the change, then launch the browser.

For Chromium on the Mac, open Terminal to launch Chromium with the switches. After some trial and error I found this did the trick: /Applications/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium --no-sandbox --enable-webgl

To run WebGL in Chromium, you have to bypass the sandbox mechanism that makes attacks harder by confining processes to regions called sandboxes. That's got risks, so it's best to drop back into the normal mode without the ""--no-sandbox"" switch when you're done. Google is addressing this issue, though.

""We are working to make WebGL work in Chrome without the user having to disable the sandbox. It's a lot of work, but we're making fast progress on it,"" said Matthew Papakipos, a Google engineering director.

One you're done, start trying the demonstrations. Be warned, though, that not all the demos work on all the browsers. And perhaps because the specification as well as the browsers are a work in progress, some other WebGL demos wouldn't work for me on any browser.

What's it like?

If you don't want to suffer the slings and arrows of pre-production software, here are my thoughts about my testing.

Overall, I'd say WebGL has potential. It's certainly not blazing fast, but it can spin 36 shaded miniatures of Earth and Mars at 60 frames per second on an Apple MacBook Pro.

Stephen Shankland/CNET

Some of the demos taxed my dual-core machines' processors, and they were hardly anything eye-popping. But there were differences in the three browsers' abilities.

WebKit seemed to handle WebGL with the least strain; its animations ran with significantly higher frame rates than Minefield or Chrome. I wouldn't judge or praise any of them too dramatically at this early stage and on limited benchmarks, though.

So what's it good for besides casual games at this stage? Not much--perhaps a little eye candy here and there, 3D models of products you're thinking of buying online, and mapping and virtual-world applications.

But as with many technologies, it's important to lay a foundation on which future developments can be built.

I've been underwhelmed by 3D in general. It's fine for many games, though those aren't typically my cup of tea. But given that my brain works in 3D, I've been disappointed in how little interfaces in operating systems and conventional software have been able to take advantage of depth as well as height and width.

However, I fully expect in the glorious future, 3D will arrive for real in displays, not just the flattened 2D versions of depth we see today. Combine that with multitouch and gestural interfaces that interpret my hand-waving and eye movements and things start getting pretty sci-fi.

It's not clear that Google's Chrome OS vision will conquer the world and the browser will be the universal application foundation. It is clear, though, that there are plenty of Web applications today, that there will be more tomorrow, and that they'll need better interface technology.

With most of the browser backers pushing it and graphics hardware increasingly common, WebGL has serious potential.

Not the only game in town

JavaScript has been streamlined with widely used libraries such as the Dojo Toolkit, jQuery, the Yahoo User Interface (YUI) library, and most recently, Google's Closure Tools. Packaged in a similar way, WebGL could be made more approachable for some tasks, too.

That's where another 3D Web technology, a Google browser plug-in called O3D, could be a factor. O3D, still under development, provides a higher-level 3D graphics interface. It could be rebuilt out of WebGL components, though, and Google believes that eventually will happen.

""It's an interesting idea, but we haven't done this so far. It's definitely possible to create higher level retained-mode renderers (like O3D) that are implemented on top of WebGL, and we expect that this will likely happen at some point,"" Google's Papakipos said. ""There are potentially some performance issues, but we're working to resolve those by making some changes to V8,"" the Chrome browser's JavaScript engine.

Gregg Tavares, a Google O3D programmer and longtime game developer, detailed some of those performance issues in a mailing list posting. ""WebGL is a very cool initiative but it has a lot of hurdles to overcome,"" he said. ""JavaScript is still slow in the large scheme of things. Maybe at sometime in the future WebGL will have added enough features over basic OpenGL to be more powerful or JavaScript will have gotten a few orders of magnitude faster but at the moment...""

The Windows connection

Another hurdle to be overcome is OpenGL driver support on graphics cards. High-end cards found in professional workstations support it, but for mainstream Windows machines, Microsoft's Direct3D is a more common interface to accelerate 3D graphics.

WebGL dovetails with OpenGL, but it's possible to link to Direct3D, too, said Arun Ranganathan, chairman of the WebGL working group and standards evangelist at Mozilla. ""There's no technical impediment to running on Direct3D. We've been careful so we don't introduce such impediments,"" Ranganathan said.

Added Vladimir Vukicevic, a Mozilla programmer who's been leading the WebGL charge, ""On Windows the Direct3D drivers are often higher quality than the OpenGL drivers.""

Of course, there's more to the world than Windows. Khronos Group spokesman Jonathan Hirshon pointed out that smartphones ship with OpenGL ES; the iPhone 3GS supports version 2.0.

Microsoft didn't comment on its plans for WebGL. It isn't a member of the Khronos Group, but of late it's been looking more favorably on Web standards when it comes to Internet Explorer's design.

Adobe Systems' Flash, too, has some 3D support, and it's widely installed. ""It would be great if they [Adobe] were to implement WebGL in AIR or Flash,"" Vukicevic said. That could help spread the technology to Internet Explorer users, he said.

The biggest competitor, though, is doing 3D in a regular operating system. There, programming tools are more mature, hardware support is more consistent, performance is better--and the industry has hardly stopped advancing.

For WebGL to truly meet its potential, browser makers will have to convince programmers to adopt a new way of working. The Web has plenty of advantages in usage and ubiquity, but it has a way to go before it can match many native operating system abilities.",html
http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-31747_7-20049401-243.html,Digital comics come to life on tablets,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Digital comics have been around for longer than the iPad, but they were previously confined to either the computer or a tiny smartphone screen. The iPad breathed life into this burgeoning field by providing a larger, colorful display that was still portable.

How the eye follows the page

In fact, one of the very first apps to debut on day one of the iPad's release in 2010 was Comixology, an app that allows you to purchase, store, and read comics right on the iPad.

Comixology's iPhone app debuted in late 2009, but it wasn't until the iPad version that the digital comic potential was realized. Comixology boasted a reading experience that's almost cinematic, supposedly mimicking how the eye follows the printed page with a mode called ""guided view."" In guided view, you read panel by panel, instead of page by page. David Steinberger, Comixology's CEO, claims that around 50 percent of its users use guided view instead of full-page mode.

Content deals soon followed, as Comixology started offering titles by Marvel and DC, the two biggest names in comics. Indeed, Comixology helped the two publishers come up with their own dedicated apps in the iTunes App Store. It has also created title-specific apps like the Scott Pilgrim app that only carries Scott Pilgrim books.

The reason is simple: Specific apps get higher level searchability in the iTunes App Store. This proved especially useful when the movie of the same name debuted and people wanted to read the books that inspired the film.

Audience diversity and growth

One of the more interesting results of digital comics on tablets and smartphones is that they typically draw in more casual consumers who are newer to comics. Steinberger said, for example, that the digital audience tends to favor pop culture hits more than traditional comic book fare. When the zombie-centric ""Walking Dead"" series debuted on AMC, digital sales of the comics on Comixology went up dramatically. This might be because casual consumers either don't know about their local comic book store or just don't want to go there.

""The [traditional] distribution of comics is lame,"" Steinberger said. ""They're not on newsstands anymore, they're not in the corner stores. They're only available to direct-market retailers and there's less distribution than it used to be. There's great opportunity here to gain a larger market [of comic readers].""

He pointed out that the app actually includes a retailer finder. While it might seem odd that Comixology is promoting its brick-and-mortar rivals, Steinberger sees them more as allies.

""Everyone expects us to be a disrupter to steal market share,"" he said. ""We feel that the way the market is shaped in the first place, there's an incredible chance here to enlarge the market. We feel that getting more people to discover comics at all is great for everyone.""

Publishers and pricing

Perhaps the most compelling reason to buy digital over print is that you get practically infinite shelf space and inventory. Back catalogs are easier to access without having to go through the disappointment of missing one or two titles in a vast collection.

But to please the true comics fan, Comixology and competitors like Graphic.ly need to deliver new comics on the same day as the print version arrives in stores--this is called day-and-date delivery, and it usually happens on Wednesdays. Some publishers already do this, like Archie, and Marvel and DC do deliver a few of their titles this way. But the numbers aren't nearly where they should be, especially with popular titles and independent releases.

The other issue is pricing. While most comics are 99 cents and $1.99 each, current issues can be $2.99 or the same price as the print version. Since the comics are DRM-protected, some readers might not feel the price is justified.

Steinberger admits that DRM might not be palatable, but it's a necessary evil--""otherwise publishers don't do this at all."" However, since Comixology offers its content not only on iOS devices, but also on the Web and on Android, Steinberger says that hopefully the seamless reading and downloading experience will make the DRM less heinous.

One way for publishers to lower the price is to go it alone without a third-party distributor. For example, Viz Media and Dark Horse have developed their own apps that you can download on the iTunes App Store. Their books are typically cheaper than their print counterparts--some Viz books are half the price, while Dark Horse charges around $1.49 per issue.

Dark Horse goes a step further to cut costs by trying to avoid Apple's e-commerce system, redirecting users to the mobile Safari app to purchase comics, much like Amazon's Kindle application.

UPDATE: We've learned that Dark Horse has changed its pricing to $1.99 per issue for in-app purchases, putting the publisher on par with the others.

Expanding market

Even though Comixology was there first, it's no longer the only player in the game. Graphic.ly is an up-and-coming competitor in the space--the company has apps for the iPhone, iPad, and Android devices. Even though Graphic.ly's library of titles is not as large, it has worked out a deal where it's the only Android app to deliver Marvel comics--Comixology's Android app blocks Marvel content, at least for now. Graphic.ly also has a social component to its app that lets you clip a panel and share it on Facebook, leave a review on individual issues, and read your friends' reviews.

While Comixology is iOS-centric, it has recently been very bullish on Android, and is working out a better in-app purchasing experience with Google. But Steinberger admits that it all started with Apple.

""Without Apple, this market would not have happened,"" he said. ""They created a sense for consumers that they should buy digital content on their devices. They make devices for image-rich content.""

Digital future

When asked about the future of digital comics, Steinberger said the first step is for publishers to get comfortable with day-and-date releases of digital copies. The risk is understandable--both retailers and publishers are afraid that sales would go down as a result.

""But we're getting a lot of data that as we're selling a lot of ""Walking Dead"" books, hard-copy sales of ""Walking Dead"" keep going up too,"" he said. ""We're expanding the market, we're not destroying the retailer. We're helping them. It's beneficial for everyone to have all content available everywhere as soon as it can.""

In fact, Comixology recently announced a digital affiliate storefront for retailers so retailers can start selling comics online, too. Steinberger claims that it's actually connected to the retailer revenue-wise, and it is in Comixology's interest for the retailer to do well.

Comixology also developed a publisher portal for self-publishers and independent creators. You can sign up, submit your books, set up the guided-view system, and use its own in-house software to create the digital comic. The book will then go on sale in the Comixology store. Obviously Comixology will take a percentage of sales and there might be an entrance fee, but it might be the easiest way to get your self-published book distributed.

""There's room for growth in the market,"" Steinberger said. ""We still love print. We have walls of trade paperbacks and hardcovers in the office.

""But digital is for people who haven't read comics in 20 years because of too much bulk, or the people who travel who don't want to carry around books,"" he continued. ""We've heard stories of comic fans who threw away their collections years ago to clear up space in the garage or the basement, and are now back because of us.""

If you live in the San Francisco Bay Area, there will be a panel about digital comics at WonderCon at Moscone South this Friday, April 1, at 7 p.m. PT. in room 220. Panelists will include David Steinberger, who was interviewed for this article, as well as Micah Baldwin, CEO of Graphic.ly, and Michael Murphey, CEO of iVerse, another distributor of digital comics.",html

Then came an Apple press release on PRNewswire.com, but no browser. Then the press release disappeared, apparently a second stumble following a rare trip-up for Steve Jobs' tightly controlled message machine during the iPhone 4 announcement, and shortly after that the browser made its debut.

Available for Windows and Mac, Safari 5 includes several new features and performance enhancements, the biggest of which has been announced but not activated. The new Safari Developer Program marks the advent of digitally signed add-ons for Safari.

Currently, only Safari for Mac supports add-ons, but the implication from the Safari Web site is that the new extension format will be cross-platform because they will be built on HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Apple is clearly trying to get some of their newly re-christened iOS mojo to rub off on the desktop Safari since the new add-ons will be ""sandboxed, signed with a digital certificate from Apple and run solely in the browser,"" according to the pulled Safari 5 press release.

Given the language used to describe the program and Apple's controlled iOS marketplace, the Safari Extensions so far sounds like an attempt to extend the iOS's philosophy to the browser, although it could wind up being nothing more than the Safari version of Mozilla add-ons site.

Safari 5 also includes Safari Reader for streamlining articles, a new add-on network, dramatic performance improvements, and support for Bing search. Safari Reader is designed to streamline the browser to maximize reading space when viewing single and multipage articles. A new Reader icon in the location bar will toggle the feature, and there are mouse-over options to enlarge the story, print it, or share it via e-mail.

HTML5 support in the new version of Safari doesn't do any major trailblazing, although it does add significant support for the next generation of HTML code. Safari now supports HTML5-based full-screen video playback, video closed captioning, geolocation, drag and drop, forms validation, HTML5 Ruby, EventSource, and WebSocket. Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Opera all support these features either in their stable releases or in generally functional development versions, leaving Internet Explorer with support only in IE 9's stripped-down pre-alpha builds.

Apple is claiming major improvements to Safari's JavaScript engine Nitro, with the version in Safari 5 running 30 percent faster than Safari 4. Apple says it also benchmarked Safari 5 to be twice as fast as Firefox 3.6, and 3 percent faster than Chrome 5.0. Safari 5 also loads Web pages faster by using DNS prefetching.

Microsoft's browser continues to lose share of worldwide usage, but its new IE9 version managed to gain enough usage that new statistics show it surpassing one smaller rival, Opera.

Internet Explorer 9 accounted for 2.41 percent of browser usage in April, its first full month on the market, according to Net Applications. Opera accounted for 2.14 percent. And IE overall dropped from 55.9 percent in March to 55.1 percent in April.

Two browsers, Google's Chrome and Apple's Safari, outpaced the overall growth in Web usage. Chrome rose from 11.6 percent to 11.9 percent, while Safari grew from 6.6 percent to 7.2 percent. Mozilla's Firefox dipped from 21.8 percent to 21.6 percent.

Mozilla has its bright spot, too: Firefox 4 accounted for 5.4 percent of usage overall, though it arrived later than IE9. It runs not just on older versions of Windows, notably Windows XP, but also on Mac OS X and Linux.

The move to modern browsers enables a new generation of more interactive Web sites and applications. Changes in IE usage are particularly important in that move because the decade-old IE6 remains the bane of Web developers. Its usage continues to gradually slip, though, and Windows 7's rise is helping to usher IE6 out.

In part because of its iOS mobile operating system, Apple had a strong showing in Web activity--though not all of that was with Safari. Apple operating systems accounted for 7.6 percent of browser usage in April. Of that 5.4 percent were browsers on Mac OS X, 1.2 percent on iPhones, 0.8 percent on iPads, and 0.2 percent on iPod Touches.

In other words, 2.2 percent of browser usage took place on Apple's mobile operating system. That may sound like a small fraction, but it's a large number of people in absolute terms.

Windows, of course, is the dominant operating system used to browse the Web. In April, Windows XP--which can't run IE9--remained the most popular, with 53.2 percent of usage. Windows 7, in second place, surpassed 1 in 4 Windows users to reach 25.1 percent.

On Windows 7, IE9 accounted for 7.5 percent of browser usage, NetApplications said.

Microsoft is ""excited"" about the IE9 results, Ryan Gavin, senior director of IE business and marketing, said in a blog post. He noted that by the end of the month, IE9 usage on Windows 7 had increased to nearly 10 percent.

IE9 serves as a vehicle for Microsoft to promote Windows 7 and to improve it for customers.

""For Windows 7 customers, the best browser for experiencing the web is IE9,"" he said in an assertion his rivals likely disagree with. ""We built IE9 to help developers unleash faster and richer web experiences that can take full advantage of the capabilities of Windows 7 and modern PC hardware. So for us, success means that we have real sites and developers taking advantage of those unique capabilities to deliver that better Web experience.""",html

In the latest Firefox 4 beta, the browser focuses on faster start-up times brought by making improvements elsewhere in the code.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, Firefox 4 beta 9 debuts new under-the-hood code for bookmarking and history. You won't see any interface changes to those features, although they do load faster now. As a consequence of those snappier load times, the browser itself will start faster, the company said in a blog post. When comparing the averages of three ""cold boot"" runs, each of which started from the computer turned off and ended with fully loading 11 JavaScript-intensive pages, between Firefox 4 beta 9 and the previous beta 8, Firefox 4 beta 9 came in nearly 10 seconds faster. Firefox 4 beta 8 averaged 41.04 seconds until all the pages had loaded, while Firefox 4 beta 9 averaged 32.48 seconds.

Another change in Firefox 4 beta 9 brings code improvements to how complex animations are rendered, and they are expected to be much smoother as a result. The changes create more than one heap for garbage data in Firefox, which will prevent multiple JavaScript objects from multiple tabs from slowing the browser down. Another consequence of the change is that JavaScript elements in memory will be shielded from each other, so if one crashes, it's less likely to take others down with it.

A new database standard has also debuted in the latest Firefox beta. Called IndexedDB, the technology replaces Web SQL and has been extensively used for managing user data in offline situations.

A final and minor change to Firefox 4 beta 9 brings the tab bar up a few pixels, so it now sits on the same row as the Firefox menu button. The top of the browser now looks extremely similar to Opera 11 and Internet Explorer 9 beta. The full and technical change log for Firefox 4 beta 9 is available here.",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-10375506-12.html,"AVG Free 9 offers speed, lacks etiquette","October,Am,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"CORRECTED October 15, 2009, 11:45 a.m.: The default search choice is not changed, as was mistakenly reported earlier. Also, it's not the user's home page that gets changed, but the new tab page. I've clarified the nonmandatory nature of the LinkScanner toolbar, and added information on the identity theft feature in the toolbar.

After giving its paying customers a few weeks to upgrade to version 9, AVG has announced its update for AVG Free 9.

For those unfamiliar with the popular freeware security tool, it provides only the bare necessities for protecting your PC, but that should be enough for savvy Windows users. AVG Free 9 introduces few new features, with improvements focused on performance, including claims of faster scan and boot times. AVG is claiming that scans are 50 percent faster compared with AVG 8.

AVG comes with a combined antivirus and antimalware engine, the proprietary LinkScanner for Web browsing safety, and e-mail scanning. Developed independently and bought by AVG in 2007, the LinkScanner tech performs two functions. It protects you from third-party code exploits before they load in your browser and it ranks search results.

Annoyingly, the optional AVG LinkScanner toolbar commandeers your new tab page, decidedly inappropriate behavior that a security vendor should really know better than to do. LinkScanner can be downloaded separately from AVG, too. The scheduler is robust, automating both scans and updates with multiple options.

One new feature in the new version is the the Identity Theft Recovery Unit. Only for users in the United States, ITRU is a business partnership with Identity Guard which provides ""consumer identity theft solutions."" Accessible only from the browser toolbar, which only works in Firefox or Internet Explorer, the service provides ""a dedicated identity theft recovery unit with fraud experts,"" to assist handling, getting and analysing a credit report, enrolling in credit file monitoring, and offering report-filing support.

The interface in AVG Free 9 remains nearly untouched from the last version, and generally it's easy to use. From the main window, though, you must double-click to get further information on any feature, whether virus scanning, LinkScanner settings, or updating. Streamlining this to one click would be helpful.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

When starting a scan, a slider makes it easy to jump between Slow, Automatic, and Fast scans: the faster the scan, the less comprehensive it is, so it's a good idea to take the program's advice and optimize your scans when you install. This will make that first scan faster. A slow scan took nearly 2 hours, while the fast scan completed in under an hour. A progress meter for these regular scans would've been useful, though. Should a virus create serious problems, AVG creates a rescue disk to scan your computer in MS-DOS mode.

Besides the LinkScanner problem, there are some other concerns with AVG. It doesn't tax your system in an obvious way when scanning or when running in the background, although CNET Labs determined that it will significantly slow down your system's boot time and will slightly delay shutting down. AVG detected some image files as threats, when two other security programs decided they weren't--these were fairly obvious false positives. There is an advertisement to upgrade at the bottom of the program window, but it can be easily hidden using the Hide Notification button.

AVG might not be the fastest or the most effective free security option, but it still gets the job done and you're better off with it.",html
https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-touts-ios-9-adoption-rate-of-more-than-50/,"Apple: Latest iPhone, iPad software surpasses 50 percent adoption",,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"CNET

The new iOS 9 software is now on more than 50 percent of iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches, according to Apple.

The company announced the figure on Monday morning, proclaiming it the fastest iOS adoption rate ever. Apple measures iOS adoption based on the number of devices that visit the Apple Store on a given date. The 50 percent mark is based on Apple's App Store stats as compiled on Saturday, September 19, the fourth day into the rollout of iOS 9.

""iOS 9 is also off to an amazing start, on pace to be downloaded by more users than any other software release in Apple's history,"" Philip Schiller, Apple's senior market VP, said in a press release on Monday.

Rolled out last Wednesday throughout the world, Apple's latest version of its mobile operating system improves and adds a variety of features. Apple refreshes the software that powers its iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices with new features and refinements that it hopes will entice users to upgrade and help it challenge Google's Android mobile operating system.

So how does iOS 9 adoption compare with that of its predecessors? Released on September 17 of last year, iOS 8 achieved a 48 percent adoption rate on September 22, 2014, as measured by the App Store. But then after that initial surge, the pace quickly started to drag, and it took until October 20 for iOS 8 adoption to climbpast the halfway point, reaching 52 percent.

iOS 8 initially suffered from several technical issues, requiring Apple to issue a number of updates until the software became more stable and reliable. Apple also started introducing new features to iOS 8, such as Apple Pay in version 8.1 and Apple Music in version 8.4.By September of this year, just days before the release of its successor, iOS 8 had ascended to an adoption level of 87 percent.

Given the initial woes with iOS 8, Apple needed to focus on reliability and stability with iOS 9 beyond adding and enhancing new features. So far, the new version seems to have avoided the severe range of problems that plagued its predecessor. But some iOS 9 users are complaining of such glitches as app crashes. Certain bugs are always to going wind their way into the release of any new software, especially as more users get their hands on it.

""The big picture here though is that this is the standard environment for a new operating system launch,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said. ""There are always going to be a spectrum of bugs but they should be solved within a few days. Apple can't get an OS to be stable until they have the full force of their base using it.""

Munster said that any glitches are likely the result of the combination of apps and hardware on iOS devices. As people send diagnostic information back to Apple after downloading the iOS 9 upgrade, Apple will be better able to fix the bugs, he added.

Apple's 50 percent number for iOS adoption is higher than those of third-party mobile analytics firms. Mixpanel, for instance, pegged iOS 9 adoption at 29 percent on Saturday and 36 percent as of Monday. FTapjoy said Monday that it's seeing a 28 percent adoption of iOS 9 across all Apple devices. And Fiksu estimated a 32 percent adoption rate as of Monday.

Apple's numbers are usually higher than those of third-party analytics firms, which gather their data based on mobile app usage among iOS devices that carry their analytics software. Such numbers tend to analyze a smaller cross-section of users and devices than Apple is likely to see at its App Store.

iOS 9 carries with it several enhancements and new features. Like Microsoft's Cortana, the Siri voice assistant can now remind you of calendar appointments. The Notes app now lets you create checklists, draw sketches and add attachments. And the Apple Maps app has more mass-transit information, including schedules and subway station entrances for urban locales such as New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, Mexico City and Beijing.

In addition, iOS 9 promises better battery life with a new low-power mode that turns off certain features when you run below a 20 percent battery charge. A new split-screen feature lets you run two apps side by side, but only if you're using the iPad Air 2 or later iPads. And Apple has added an app called News, which aggregates different news sources to keep up with the latest stories around the world.

On a related note, Apple announced Monday that the new iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus would be available to customers who visit its retail stores starting at 8 a.m. local time on Friday, September 25. The new phones will be available to walk-in customers, though Apple is advising people to arrive early. The new models will also be sold through AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless, as well as other carriers and select Apple resellers.",html

Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference is going on now here in San Francisco, and CNET is on the scene to bring you the news live, as it happens.

Transcript starts here

9:45 a.m.: Ahhhh, much better. We're all seated and have real keyboards now. Good morning, everyone. Once again, thanks for joining us!

9:54 a.m.: For everyone asking about a live stream, Apple is not doing one for today's keynote. Expect to see them throw it up later today in full.

9:59 a.m.: A little James Brown just came on over the loudspeakers and got a big chuckle from the crowd.

10:01 a.m.: All right, everyone, Steve Jobs out, to a huge round of applause.

Donald Bell/CNET

10:02 a.m.: Standing ovation from developers. Jobs is wearing a black turtleneck, jeans, and a big grin.

""It always helps, and I appreciate it very much."" he says.

5,200 attendees [at WWDC this year]. [The show] sold out in 2 hours.

Jobs is apologizing that the company can't sell more tickets because this is the biggest place the company can get for the event.

10:05-10:06 a.m.: Phil Schiller will be joined by Craig Federighi, new Mac guy who took over earlier this year.

More than 120 sessions, 100 hands-on labs, over 1,000 Apple engineers.

Schiller: More than 54 million active Mac users around the world and growing.

Schiller is now bringing up IDC numbers with the PC shrinking 1 percent, and Mac going up 28 percent. Schiller now talking about Mac growing every quarter for the past 5 years.

10:07 a.m.: For those asking about how Jobs looked, lots of ""wow, he looks thin..."" from nearby developers. He seems very, very happy to be here though.

10:07 a.m.: Schiller throws up a screen of Mac OS X from when it was first out. Lots of laughs and cheers. Schiller asks what's next? Well, Lion. More than 250 new features, Schiller says.

We're learning about 10 new features of Lion.

10:09 a.m.: Feature #1. Multitouch gestures: This is a feature the company's already been over from the October event. But Schiller's talking about how useful it is, including getting rid of scroll bars on the side of windows because users now have a better sense of where they are on the page.

10:10 a.m.: Feature #2. Full-screen applications to take advantage of every pixel: Full screen can stay running in full screen. Apple's employed a new gesture to swap back and forth between full-screen apps, just like alt+tab.

10:11 a.m.: Feature #3. Mission Control: Another feature unveiled back in October. This is the bird's-eye view of all your apps and windows.

10:12-10:13 a.m.: Now Craig Federighi, who took over to run the Mac group earlier this year, is giving us a demo.

Federighi's talking up how scroll bars are no longer needed. Apple's also employed the double-tap gesture from iOS into Lion to let you zoom in on a specific section.

There's also a new way to navigate between Web pages with a swipe gesture. Lots of applause from the audience on that one. Very visual.

10:15 a.m.: Now we're getting a demo of full-screen Photobooth. Now with birds that track your head.

10:16 a.m.: We're getting a demo of Mission Control now. Craig is showing how to manage files across Spaces using multitouch gestures.

10:17 a.m.: Feature #4. The Mac App Store.

10:18 a.m.: Schiller says the Mac App Store has become the leading channel for buying software in the last 6 months.

10:19 a.m.: Schiller says the creators of Pixelmator made $1M their first day. New feature: in-app purchase, push notifications, sandboxing.

10:20 a.m.: Also delta updates so users don't need to reload the entire app every time there's an update.

10:20 a.m.: Feature #5. Launchpad: another feature we saw back in October. This is the iOS-like interface of app icons.

10:21 a.m.: Feature #6. Resume: the feature that lets you turn off your computer without losing work from whatever app you were on.

10:22-10:24 a.m.: Feature #8. Versions: Lets you go back in time (a la Time Machine) to go back to an older snapshot. Schiller says the only data that's stored is what's different, so it doesn't take up a ton of space.

Schiller's now talking up the Versions feature, which he promises gets rid of the need to remember to save your work. Now apps have a little drop-down right on the menu bar that lets you revert back to previous versions of an application.

This system also lets you lock documents like a template, duplicate a document to fork it as well.

10:24 a.m.: Craig's back up to give us a demo of these features. Now we're seeing Launchpad.

10:26 a.m.: We're getting a demo/sales pitch for the Mac App Store, with Federighi demoing how you can re-download applications you may have purchased on another machine.

10:27 a.m.: Now we're getting a demo of the auto-save feature. You can quit applications and have them remember exactly what you were doing in an application, including things like window placement and text highlighting.

10:28 a.m.: Pretty neat actually, you can do a comparison between two different versions, and fly through past edits to see if there's something you might have liked from an older update, then just drop it into the newer one.

Drag and drop between old and new versions. And that's it for that demo. Now on to the rest of the features.

10:28 a.m.: Feature #9 is AirDrop.

10:30 a.m.: How AirDrop works: you can see other people on your network just like you would with computers. Then you can drag files to them. They get the message you want to send something to them, and can confirm to receive.

10:31 a.m.: Feature #10 is Mail. Schiller is talking up how you have a 2- and 3-column view. It's all about reading your mail, Schiller says. It's also taken on features like a Web browser, with a favorites menu up top.

Donald Bell/CNET

10:32 a.m.: Also new: Conversation view groups together similar messages so you can see a flow of conversation. Big round of applause for that.

10:33 a.m.: And now we're getting a demo of Mail from Federighi. When you start typing into the search bar, it gives you little search tweaks along the left-hand side of the window to re-target it toward specific types of messages. Kind of like what you get in Google's Gmail.

10:35 a.m.: And finally we're getting a demo of conversation view. Lots of iOS feel here: bouncy menus, pop-down items.

10:36 a.m.: Schiller is wrapping up on other Lion features: a new migration tool for Windows users. Safari reading list, push notifications.

Schiller says there are 3,000 new APIs for developers to use to build applications.

How are we gonna get it? Schiller asks. Schiller says Lion will only be available on Mac App Store.

10:37 a.m.: Wow, that's a big move. Schiller says it's going to be the easiest update ever. 4GB in size, about the size of an HD movie you'd download.

10:38 a.m.: How much? Most major releases have been $129. We love it so much, Schiller says--$29.

Big round of applause for that. ""I was hoping you were going to like it."" Schiller says the latest developer preview is available today. Customers get it in July.

10:39 a.m.: iOS 5 is up now. Coming up is Scott Forstall, SVP of iOS software. He's getting a big round of applause as he saunters up on stage.

He's giving an update on iOS: 200 million iOS devices sold to date. That makes it the No. 1 mobile operating system, with more than 44 percent of the market, Forstall says. Data is Comscore from April.

10:40-10:41 a.m.: Forstall's talking up the iPad 2. In the first 14 months, we've already sold 25 million iPads.

He says: ""We've created a whole new category of device with the iPad.""

More than 15 billion songs sold by the iTunes music store. That makes it the #1 retailer of music in the world. As for the iBooks store, which launched less than a year ago, Forstall says more than 130 million books have been downloaded.

On the App Store: Currently more than 425,000 apps on the App Store.

10:42 a.m.: More than 90,000 of these are specifically for the iPad, Forstall says. 14 billion downloads from the App Store, in less than three years. Apple has paid out more than $2.5 billion to developers on the App Store.

10:43 a.m.: Forstall's going through some of the high-profile apps, like HBO Go, Tiny Wings, and apps that have been FDA and FAA approved.

225 million accounts with credit cards and 1-click purchasing.

10:44-10:45 a.m.: Now onto iOS 5: Major release, Forstall says. 1,500 new APIs for developers.

For users: [there are] more than 200 new features. We're seeing 10 of those today.

#1. Notifications: Big round of applause from that. Forstall going over the previous system doing pop-up windows, badge icons, and sounds. Forstall says Apple's pushed more than 100 billion push notifications.

Customers were saying we need a better UI. Forstall says we've built something that solves the current problem, which is that it distracts you. Also, on the lock screen you get a list of things that have happened, but you can't go back to that list.

10:46 a.m.: Forstall says the new system solves this. Now called ""Notification Center,"" a single place that combines all your notifications. Can get to it from anywhere, just by wiping your finger down on the screen.

Stocks and weather are included up at the very top, so you don't need to open those apps. The messages fade in from the top in a nice little roll.

10:47 a.m.: Lock screen now gives you a complete rundown of text messages, missed calls, and app updates. And if you slide your finger over that app, it takes you right there.

Now we're getting a demo of it. You literally slide the icon across the screen, and it takes you right there.

10:48 a.m.: Users can clear out any notifications just by hitting a little ""x"" button on that list. The swipe functionality works from any app you're in, Forestall says.

10:49 a.m.: Feature #2. Newsstand: Talking up subscriptions now, and how you can get magazines with subscriptions.

The app icon for it looks just like a bookshelf, suggesting that it will basically be iBooks for magazines and newspapers.

Donald Bell/CNET

10:50 a.m.: Looks just like the App Store or iTunes. The app opens up just like a folder on your home screen, and if you buy an item, new issues will be delivered in the background, so users don't need to manually go and grab it.

10:51-10:52 a.m.: Feature #3. Twitter: Forstall says more than 1 billion tweets are sent each week. Customers love Twitter, and the company wants to make it easier. Single sign-on for Twitter, so you can enter your credentials in iOS settings.

Integrated Twitter into camera and photos. Users can now send to Twitter from here. This feature comes up as a little pop-up menu of sorts that lets you fire off the tweet from wherever. Also works from YouTube, Safari, Maps.

10:53 a.m.: [There's] integration with contacts too, so it can grab photos from a user's Twitter account. So if a user updates their photo on Twitter, it will get updated on your iPhone.

Donald Bell/CNET

10:54 a.m.: Feature #4. Safari getting a reader feature, so if you're on a story with bad formatting you can see it in a stripped down, RSS-like view.

You can e-mail contents of an entire story from right within Safari. Before, you could only e-mail the link or go through the trouble of copy and paste.

10:55 a.m.: The second part of that is ""Reading List,"" which lets you bookmark a story to read it later. And that list gets synced up with your list on the computer.

Instapaper and Read it Later are probably not going to be happy about this.

10:55 a.m.: Other feature: tabbed browsing on the iPad.

10:56 a.m.: Forstall's now giving us a demo of it running on an iPad. Switching between tabs is quite fast, he says as he whips through the pages. Yes, it does look pretty fast.

From Jason Parker: It's great to see tabbed browsing--we used to have to use other apps to be able to quickly switch between sites.

10:57 a.m.: Giving a demo on a camera review site with a 20-page review. Reader turns it into one document you can scroll through.

10:58-10:59 a.m.: Forstall demos Twitter running in Safari on the iPad. Comes up as a little pop-up, then disappears once you tweet.

Feature #5. Reminders: Grocery lists, snippets, paper.

Reminders app lets you store multiple lists, including dates for each event. Can also assign location, as in ""remind me to call my wife when I leave the convention today,"" which uses a geo-fence to see when you're outside of an area to send that reminder.

Reminders sync on iCal on the Mac with CalDAV, and on Windows with MS Exchange, Forstall says.

11:00 a.m.: Feature #6. Camera app. Forstall's talking up how popular the iPhone 4 has become on Flickr, soon the most popular camera overall.

Lockscreen shortcut to take a photo. So no more need to unlock your phone, find the app.

11:01 a.m.: Camera icon shows up directly to the right of the unlock slider. Launches camera app immediately. Even if you have a passcode set, Forstall says it will load the app regardless. And you can use the volume up button to take a photo, which gets a huge round of applause.

11:02-11:03 a.m.: Tap Tap Tap got in trouble for doing that, by the way.

Photo app now includes grid lines, pinch to zoom, and if you hold your finger up and down the screen it changes the exposure, adding granular controls. Can even edit photos now: crop and rotate, red eye reduction.

1-click enhance from iPhoto coming over to the photos app as well to let you do a quick color correction from the device.

11:04-11:05 a.m.: Feature #7. Mail: Rich text formatting, can do bold, underline. Can indent. Can drag addresses between the to, cc, bcc. Flagging and unflagging. Search can also now search within messages, not just the from, to, and subject lines.

And on the iPad, users in portrait mode can now swipe in to see the inbox on the left-hand side of the screen. Also for the security/IT folks, there's S/MIME support.

Forstall's giving us a demo of the new Mail app on an iPad with iOS 5. Now there's a built-in dictionary, so if you see a word you don't know, it can give you a definition right in the message.

11:06 a.m.: New variant of the keyboard for iOS 5 on the iPad [for those] who like to use it. Splits the keyboard in half. Moves the keyboard right by where your thumbs are. Lots of oohs and ahhs on that one.

11:07 a.m.: Feature #8. PC Free. Huge applause on that one.

Forstall saying that the company's built these incredible devices, then they get them out of the box, then they realize they need to plug it into something.

Donald Bell/CNET

11:08-11:10 a.m.: [There's a] big ""Post PC"" slide up. Forstall says a lot of people who are buying these devices don't have computers. Now when you buy an iOS device, you get a little ""welcome"" message instead of the plug-into-iTunes logo.

Software updates are now over the air.

No more need to plug into iTunes to get that update. The updates are also a delta, so it's not the entire OS, it's just what's changed.

To make all this happen, Apple's had to decouple apps from their computer counterpart. You can now create and delete calenders from iOS. Edit photos without having to use a computer app, etc. Forstall says Apple went through every app to figure out what needed to get done to make that happen.

11:10 a.m.: Next is Game Center. More than 100,000 game and entertainment titles on the App Store.

11:11 a.m.: In 9 months, Apple says there are 50 million Game Center users. Forstall says Microsoft's Xbox Live has been around for 8 years, and they have about 30 million users.

New to Game Center: Photos, achievement point comparison, friends of friends, recommended friends, game recommendations.

Can now buy and download games directly from Game Center. Also support for turn-based games like Scrabble.

11:12 a.m.: Feature #10: iMessage: Forstall says message app on iPhone is the best. But what about the iPad and iPod Touch customers?

iMessage is one service for all those customers and devices. Supports iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.

Send text, photos, videos, contacts, group messaging.

11:14 a.m.: Delivery receipts. Can see if a message has been delivered. Read receipts too.

Typing indication to see if someone's typing to you.

Conversations are pushed to all devices.

Works on 3G and Wi-Fi networks.

Secure encryption.

11:15 a.m.: Forstall's coming up to demo now. We've got an iPhone and an iPad to demo how iMessage works. The message comes up at the very top without interrupting the game (which is Cut the Rope).

11:16 a.m.: Very neat demo here. You can see that the other person is typing, just like in an IM app.

On the iPad the UI looks a lot like the Mail app, except with the SMS interface on the right.

Forstall says it's built on Apple's push notification service, so it will scale.

11:17-11:19 a.m.: He's wrapping up on the iOS 5 list of features now.

Hourly weather forecasts, Wi-Fi sync to iTunes, new iPad music app, iTunes tone store, Airplay mirroring, personal dictionary.

Alternate routes in Maps, Emoji emoticons, custom vibration patterns.

Xvode's also been updated, with Core Image framework, which is getting lots of hoots from the developers.

11:20 a.m.: Developers get a seed of iOS 5 today.

iOS 5 shipping to customers this fall. iOS 5 will support the same set of devices as with the previous update, Forstall says.

11:20-11:21 a.m.: And now onto iCloud, presented by Jobs himself.

""You like everything so far?"" Jobs asks. ""Well, I'll try not to blow it.""

Jobs says about 10 years ago the company had one of its most important insights. The PC would become the digital hub for your digital life. That's where you put your photos. Your digital video too. And your music.

And that's how it worked for the better part of 10 years, but it's broken down in the last 10 years, Jobs says. It's because the devices have changed. They now all have music, photos, and video. So if you buy a song on your iPhone, you want to bring it to the other devices.

11:22 a.m.: Keeping these devices in sync is driving us crazy, Jobs says, to a big round of applause.

We've got a great solution to this problem, Jobs says. We're going to demote the PC and the Mac to be the device, just like an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch. Now the hub is in the cloud.

Now if you get something on your iPhone, like a picture, it goes up to the cloud, and gets pushed down to the other devices automatically.

11:23 a.m.: Jobs says you don't have to do anything, it just happens.

iCloud stores your content, and wirelessly pushes it to all your devices.

iCloud is integrated with your apps, so everything happens automatically, Jobs says. ""It just works"" is the tagline.

11:24-11:25 a.m.: Jobs takes a knock at MobileMe: ""Why should I believe these guys?""

""It wasn't our finest hour, let me just say that. But we learned a lot."" Jobs says.

Calendar, Mail, and Contacts have been rewritten to be iCloud apps, Jobs says. If you make an edit to a contact, it goes to the cloud, then it gets pushed to the other devices.

11:26-11:27 a.m.: For calendars; you make a new calendar event, it's stored in the cloud and it's pushed to all your devices. Calendar sharing too, so if you're on a calendar with other people, any changes are pushed out to others too.

Calendars are stored in iCloud, changes on any device pushed to all your devices, and you have shared calendars, Jobs says.

As for Mail: users get an account @me.com, and inbox and folders are kept up to date on all devices. And there's no ads, Jobs says to applause.

11:27 a.m.: We used to sell it for $99, Jobs says. As of today this product ceases to exist. Now it's free, Jobs says.

MobileMe is dead, folks.

11:28 a.m.: Three more apps that are a part of the iCloud universe, Jobs says. First is the App Store. You bought a lot of apps, and now those sync up between devices.

You can see the purchase history on the devices and download it on demand (they don't sync up automatically).

11:29 a.m.: Also coming to iBooks, so it will sync up books you've bought.

When you buy it, it will download it to all your devices, and whatever page you're on is synced up with iCloud.

11:30-11:31 a.m.: Cloud backup too. Wireless backup to the iCloud. Once daily it backs up contents of your iOS device to the cloud. If you get a new iOS device, you type in your Apple ID and it gets synced up to that device.

Daily backups done over Wi-Fi, Jobs says. That includes camera roll, device settings, apps, and app data too (meaning you won't lose your high score, or progress in a title).

11:32 a.m.: Final 3 apps for iCloud, which Jobs says are amazing and the most inventive part of iCloud.

Documents is the first.

If you're on the iPad and create a Pages document, it saves it to the cloud. That document is pushed to other devices that have Apple's Pages app installed. Now a feature in Pages, Numbers, and Keynote. The iWork versions that went out last week secretly had this in there, Jobs says.

11:33 a.m.: Roger Rosner, VP of iWork, is up on stage to give us a demo of how this works in the wild.

Rosner's showing off how you can work on a presentation in iWork, then see it get synced over to the other device.

11:34-11:35 a.m.:Demo worked, and now we're seeing a presentation within a presentation. This is like Inception.

Rosner doing some quick edits to a document in Pages, then once again showing how it sends that file to iCloud.

11:35 a.m.: Jobs is back up now after that brief interlude. Jobs says the documents in the cloud ""completes"" the iOS documents storage story.

11:36 a.m.: Jobs says teaching people how to use computers is the easy part until you get to the file system, then people get confused. This promises to solve that, Jobs says.

Apps can store documents in iCloud. iCloud pushes documents automatically, and documents get updated on all devices.

To make this happen, there are new iCloud storage APIs for developers.

11:37 a.m.: The new system will work on Macs and PCs, Jobs promises.

11:38 a.m.: Two more to go, folks. Jobs says it's ""maybe"" his favorite one. It's called ""Photo Stream.""

Jobs saying you go out and take photos of your kids, and you don't want to bring back your gear to sync it up. iCloud promises to fix that by bringing your entire camera roll to the cloud, then syncing it with other devices.

11:39 a.m.: I wonder what this means to photo leaks around the world...

From Jason Parker: Certain celebrities are going to have to be extra careful now...

11:39 a.m.: This works for photos you've taken, as well as photos that have been imported to the camera roll through something like Apple's camera accessory. The new feature is built into the Photo Roll app.

11:40 a.m.: As far as getting it on the Mac, it's built into iPhoto. So for PCs, it goes into the pictures folder. It's also in Apple TV, Jobs says.

The Apple TV taps into the Photo Stream servers and grabs the photos so there's no AirPlay required.

11:42-11:43 a.m.: On iOS, it stores the last 1,000 photos. Any photos you want to keep permanently need to be moved to an album, Jobs says. As for PCs and Macs, everything's stored. Jobs says after 30 days, a photo is wiped off Apple's servers, which got some developer groans.

Eddy Cue, Apple's VP of Internet services, is up to give a demo of Photo Stream in action.

Cue's taking a photo of Owen Wilson's character from Disney's ""Cars"" on his iPhone, and demoing how it just popped up on the photos app on the iPad.

To save these photos you have to manually go through and tag each one for moving it into a folder, which looks like kind of a drag.

That photo also popped up into iPhoto as well, as advertised.

11:44 a.m.: Jobs is back up, saying ""Isn't that awesome?""

Works over Wi-Fi, not 3G apparently. That would answer some of your battery life worries, readers.

11:44 a.m.: Last app: iTunes in the cloud.

11:45 a.m.: ""It's the same old story,"" Jobs says. ""I buy something on my iPhone, and it's not on my other devices.""

Songs you've already bought--there's now a purchase button to see a past history of all the songs you've bought.

11:46 a.m.: You can redownload any of the albums you've bought to that device, and songs too. This is at no additional charge, Jobs says.

11:46 a.m.: First time we've seen this in the music industry, Jobs says.

There's also an option to automatically have songs you've bought get downloaded to your other devices.

Cue's back up now to give a demo of how this works.

11:47 a.m.: The option to redownload music just shows up as a little tab within the iTunes app, so there's not a new app for this.

11:48 a.m.: Cue goes to a Foo Fighters song he bought, and hits the new little cloud button to redownload it to the device he's on.

And 20 seconds later he has the song on his iPhone.

11:49-11:50 a.m.: Now Cue's demoing how this works when syncing that purchase from the iPhone to an iPad. He goes ahead and buys it, and it pops up on the iPad's music library a second later. Lots of claps for that.

Jobs says the system works with music purchased from iTunes, up to 10 devices work, and the quality is 256kbps AAC.

Jobs says all nine of these apps are free.

11:50 a.m.: So looks like no personal music library, folks.

11:51 a.m.: How do you get it? Jobs asks. Plugging in your Apple ID to iOS 5 lets you turn it on.

Everyone gets 5GB of free storage for Mail, Documents, and backup. Not counting purchased apps, music, or books into that number, Jobs says.

11:52 a.m.: Photo Stream does not count toward that 5GB either.

iCloud is launching today as part of a developer beta, Jobs says.

End users are getting the music redownloading part as part of a 4.3 beta, Jobs says.

11:53 a.m.: One more thing, Jobs says.

It's about iTunes in the cloud, Jobs says. Particularly music you bought.

What about music you bought yourself? You can sync your devices over Wi-Fi or a cable, and you only have to sync it once, and then you can rely on iCloud to get new purchases off iTunes.

11:54-11:55 a.m.: Buy the songs you'll miss on iTunes.

Apple's also offering ""iTunes Match""

iTunes has 18 million songs, Jobs says. Apple has software that will match your music to the songs they have in the store. Jobs says that music can get the same benefit as the songs you've bought off iTunes. This takes minutes, Jobs says.

It scans and matches your library with no upload. Then it matches those songs to an upgraded, 256kbps AAC DRM-free file. That's $24.99 per year, Jobs says.

Donald Bell/CNET

11:57 a.m.: Jobs is now stacking this up against Amazon and Google's efforts, saying that there's no upgrade to the higher quality songs, a fixed annual fee, and the same fee no matter how many songs you've bought.

Jobs says most customers won't need this feature since they buy off iTunes, but it's there for those that do.

11:58 a.m.: Including the insides which Jobs says is ""full of expensive stuff."" Including some fancy looking servers.

""If you don't think we're serious about this, you're wrong,"" Jobs says. Jobs is now showing photos of the Maiden, N.C., data center.

Now Jobs is wrapping up, looks like that's it.

11:58 a.m.: Thanks for watching everybody!

http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20068145-12.html,Windows 8 premiere raises more questions than answers,"June,Pm,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"The successor to Windows 7 debuted today at the D9 conference, and so far it appears to be Windows Phone 7's interface and tile-style of app management bolted on top of Windows 7.

Code-named ""Windows 8"" by Microsoft, the next-generation operating system is notable for two features: it's the first major attempt by the operating system giants to elevate a mobile OS to desktop status, and it's expected to be touch-friendly and work seamlessly on tablets, desktops, and laptops.

(Credit: Rafe Needleman/CNET)

This Windows 8 preview video from Jensen Harris, director of program management for Windows, certainly looks impressive. The ""app tiles"" concept from Windows Phone 7 has been blown up, expanded to suit a larger, horizontal screen. In many ways, this makes sense. Having a persistent, real-time weather or traffic feature on your desktop is something that you can now achieve with a multitude of programs and widgets, but making them look and feel like mobile apps better positions Windows to reach younger consumers whose first computing experience is likely to be a high-powered tablet or phone, not a 186 running DOS.

Windows 8 also appears to meld Windows 7's file-sharing tools to the friendlier, touch-tacular mobile interface. You can easily tap locally stored and networked photos to select them, adding them to your albums, the implication being that this would work for documents, videos, and music. Perhaps the world is, in fact, ready for a dual-input computer, one that you can use a keyboard and mouse with as naturally as you can tap, swipe, and pinch its screen. This is definitely one aspect of Windows 8 that must be watched.

Most importantly for legacy Windows users, including all of us on Windows 7, getting to the Windows 7-based view is simple. All you'll have to do is swipe up from the bottom of the screen, although it's not really clear how well this would work with a mouse. Windows 7 programs are expected to work on this new version, said Steven Sinofsky, president of Windows, although this doesn't jibe with what we heard at Mix 2011 about Internet Explorer 10. The next version of IE, at least as of April, was not expected to work on pre-Windows 8 computers. What's more logical to conclude, although not guaranteed, of course, is that the Windows 8-specific features of Internet Explorer 10 won't function in Windows 7 or older, although the more traditional aspects of the browser will.

Another important nod to current users is that legacy Windows 7 hardware is expected to support Windows 8--again, at least so far. It's certainly not out of the realm of possibility that Microsoft could pull an Apple here and force people who want to upgrade to buy newer hardware.

So, we've got probable legacy hardware support, potentially easy access to the traditional interface, what appears to be some smart sharing features, and a nifty split keyboard for mobile usability. We also know that there are questions surrounding programs, how many major core Windows legacy programs will be supported, and how the traditional Windows 7 programs that do work on Windows 8 will function under the greasy touch of a finger when they currently require the precise control of a mouse.

(Credit: via AllThingsD)

That leaves us with the two biggest questions, ones that will only get answered once consumers get their hands on whatever Windows 8 winds up getting called. The first is, do people really want a dual-operating system setup? BlueStacks seems to think so, offering an intriguing marriage of Windows 7 and Android, but that hasn't hit the public yet. Although Microsoft says that the integration between the HTML5 and JavaScript-powered Windows Phone 7 side and the traditional Windows 7 side is tighter than many would expect, that doesn't mean that a double-dose of Windows is the upgrade people want.

Riding the tail of that question, we're also left wondering whether Windows Phone 7 has had the kind of consumer impact that warrants this elevation. According to Neilsen market research, Windows Phone 7 commands only 1 percent of the U.S. smartphone marketshare, and as CNET's Donald Bell noted during CNET's Live Blog of the Windows 8 reveal at D9 (read the transcript here), the WP7 interface is the successor to the discontinued ZuneHD.

There's too many reasons that this isn't ""Vista II: Electric Boogaloo."" Windows 7, and this successor, are both Microsoft's first hardware-downgrade compatible operating systems in more than a decade. That means that the new operating system will run on less than cutting-edge hardware. Windows 7 is also a proven, successful base to bolt a more touch-friendly interface to, a critically acclaimed one that users have demonstrated they want by the still-increasing Windows 7 adoption rates in the marketplace, more than a year and a half after its release.

Were Apple to do this--bolting the popular and intuitive iOS on top of OS X with a smooth way to transition between the two--there would be far fewer uncertainties. Still, hedging bets on a look and feel that has not set the world on fire is a gutsy move, and congratulations are due to Microsoft for being the first to attempt it.",html

LAS VEGAS -- Apple today gave its first-ever talk at the Black Hat security conference, and it left me feeling like I'd had a really disappointing Match.com date with the hottest guy on the dating site.

The vaunted Apple decided to show up after snubbing the event for 15 years. As manager of the platform security team at Apple, Dallas De Atley seemed to have everything a Black Hat attendee could want -- popularity, experience, discriminating taste, a good sense of style, and a promising future. Playing hard to get only makes us want you more.

But 15 minutes in, I was ready for the check. Atley spent an hour doing a slide presentation on the architecture in iOS. There was nothing new from what's in the iOS Security white paper Apple released earlier this year.

Atley was in a hurry to leave afterward and didn't have a question-and-answer session as is customary. I thought maybe some private sweet talk from me could open him up, but he claimed he had an appointment and his entourage quickly shuffled him out the door. There was a universal sense of deflation in the room and we all went back to our lives.

I know it was too much to expect that this desire for him would be requited, and we should feel grateful he showed up at all. Let's see if we get a second date next year and if he's ready by then to really get acquainted.",html
http://reviews.cnet.com/apple-ipad-2-review/,Apple iPad 2 review:,,2011-03-11T01:13:00-08:00,"Editors' note (October 23, 2012): While Apple now sells a fourth-generation iPad with a faster A6X processor and a Lightning connector and a smaller 7.9-inch iPad Mini, the 16GB iPad 2 reviewed here remains on the market ($399 for the Wi-Fi version, $529 for the AT&T 3G or Verizon 3G version).

The competition must really hate Apple. The Apple iPad wasn't just a successful tablet computer in 2010--it was the tablet computer. In one fell swoop, Apple created the new tablet market and sold tens of millions of iPads in spite of a global economic downturn and considerable skepticism.

The same, only better

With the iPad's second go-around, Apple sticks to its successful formula. The iPad 2 is thinner, faster, and includes two cameras, but otherwise, the iPad stays the same: size, price, capacity, and features all carry over.

Oh, except for color. Apple now offers both white and black versions of the iPad 2 in every price and configuration. The base model starts at $499, giving you 16GB of storage and a Wi-Fi connection to the Internet. If you want more storage for all your applications, photos, music, and videos, you can jump up to the 32GB ($599) or 64GB ($699) models.

The freedom to surf the Web over a 3G cellular connection costs an extra $130 for any of the three models mentioned above, plus monthly carrier fees. Unlike with the original iPad, you now have a choice of two carriers (Verizon or AT&T). Choose carefully, though, since the Verizon version of the iPad can't be made to work on AT&T, and vice versa.

The hardware

The iPad 2 is thin--so thin, in fact, that it feels like a different device. Measuring just 0.34 of an inch, it's thinner than the iPhone 4 and a third thinner than the original iPad.

Despite the thinner design, its construction quality is no less rugged than the original's. The back of the iPad is still made from a durable, single slab of aluminum machined to fit the iPad's internal components like a glove. The face of the iPad is covered in the same scratch-resistant glass, with a home button at the bottom of the screen and a new front-facing camera at the top.

Otherwise, the iPad 2 sticks to familiar iPad routines. The sleep/wake buttons and headphone jack are in the same place as on the original, up top, as are the volume rocker and mute/rotation lock switch on the right edge. On the bottom you'll find the iPad's universal dock connection and the internal speaker. The speaker's perforated grille now wraps around the back, giving it more surface area and noticeably better sound quality.



The height and width may look similar, but in terms of thickness, the iPad has done some dieting, shrinking from 13.4mm thick on the original model to 8.8mm thick for the iPad 2. It's thinner, even, than the iPhone 4.

For the iPad 2, Apple has avoided compatibility shenanigans. With the exception of any original iPad cases, the device works with first-gen accessories (docks, adapters, speakers, video cables, chargers), though first-gen docks don't fit like a glove. An updated standard dock for the iPad 2 is available. For keyboard support, Apple now recommends its Bluetooth wireless keyboard.

The iPad 2 accessory that's really getting all the attention is Apple's new Smart Cover. An answer to all the bulky, overdone, rubber third-party cases made for the first iPad, Apple's unique hinged cover comes in two materials--leather ($59) and polyurethane ($39)--and multiple colors. It attaches magnetically to the left or right edge of the iPad 2 using two aluminum hinges embedded with impressively strong rare-earth magnets. Magnets within the cover are used to detect when the cover is open or shut, allowing the iPad 2 to automatically wake or sleep. It works, but you also have the option in Settings to bypass the automatic wake feature and use the button manually.

As accessories go, the Smart Cover is nifty--not so much for the protection it offers, but for the convenient stand it provides when rolled up. If, on the other hand, you are seriously concerned about protecting your investment, keeping the iPad 2 in a traditional wraparound case is still the best way to go.

Features: New stuff

The iPad 2 isn't a radical departure from the original, but it does have a few new tricks up its sleeve.

The banner feature for the iPad 2 is the addition of two cameras, both able to record video or snap photos. The camera on the back is located in the upper-right corner where it isn't likely to be covered by your hand (in portrait orientation, at least). It looks just like the chrome-ringed lens on the iPhone 4 and is similarly blessed with 720p video capture. There's no camera flash, however, and the camera sensor is a far cry from the one used in the iPhone 4. Just like the fourth-generation iPod Touch, the iPad 2 takes photos that are essentially video stills. A gallery of photos taken with the iPad 2 can be seen here.



The iPad 2 boasts two cameras; the original iPad doesn't even have one. The rear-facing camera, pictured here, supports 720p video capture.

Even if Apple had gone the route of using a Carl Zeiss lens and a 10-megapixel sensor, the iPad 2 just isn't a replacement for a camera or smartphone. Having tested the camera quality of tablets over the past year, we can't stress enough how silly you feel shooting videos or photos with a tablet in public. It's like taking a picture with a cutting board. Your grandfather's camera was less conspicuous. You get looks, and they're not the envious kind.



The iPad's rear-facing camera won't replace your point-and-shoot, but the image quality isn't bad.

Really, the cameras are there as a way to support Apple's FaceTime video chat app, which is now available for Mac, iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad 2. If you've been waiting for the Jetsons' video phone, FaceTime on the iPad gets you pretty close. Unlike smaller devices, the iPad's 9.7-inch screen can present faces at life-size. We've seen this before with desktop- and laptop-based video calling, but it can be uncanny to actually hold an image of someone's life-size face in your hands. FaceTime still remains a Wi-Fi-only feature, however, so in-car iPad video calls are an elusive capability (probably to humanity's advantage).

Other iPad 2 apps designed by Apple include GarageBand and iMovie, which must be purchased separately for $4.99 each. The iPad is the last of Apple's iOS devices to be blessed with iMovie (and the camera required for it), but is the first to receive GarageBand. We have separate write-ups of GarageBand for iPad and iMovie for iPad available for more depth.

Under the hood, the iPad 2 has plenty to brag about. The new spec uses a dual-core A5 processor that promises to be twice as fast with nine times the graphics performance. If gaming graphic quality is an important consideration for you, you can jump ahead to the Performance section of this review.

Another feature sure to burn the competition is full HDMI AV output compatibility. Using a $39 dock cable, the iPad can now mirror its output to a TV over a standard HDMI connection. The supported resolution goes up to 1080p, though video playback and most apps never break out of 720p. Unlike previous video-out solutions for the iPad, this cable no longer limits users to simply video playback or presentations. Everything you see on the screen is mirrored on your TV, including video, photos, games, and the home screen. Competitors such as RIM's BlackBerry PlayBook and the Motorola Xoom have been waving HDMI compatibility as a key advantage over the iPad. Now they have one fewer bragging point.

The iPad 2 also adds the same three-axis gyroscope sensor shared by the iPhone 4 and iPod Touch, giving the device a more detailed sense of its orientation in space, similar to the feeling of holding a Nintendo Wii remote. The gyro's appeal is mostly for gaming, allowing for more precise motion control and realistic navigation within virtual environments. In a first-person shooter game like N.O.V.A., for instance, you can tilt the iPad 2's screen up, down, left, or right to explore the game's surroundings, just like a window into the game's universe.

Features: Oldies but goodies

Cameras and gyros are nice, but let's not forget all the features that made the original iPad unbeatable. If you've ever used an iPhone or iPod Touch, the iPad 2 will feel immediately familiar. Out of the box, you get many of the iPhone's capabilities, including Apple-designed apps for Web browsing, e-mail, maps, photos, music, video, and YouTube. More apps can be installed using the built-in App Store software or by connecting the iPad to iTunes via your computer using the included cable. If you already own apps purchased for an iPhone or iPod Touch, you can transfer these apps to the iPad, as well.

The original iPad made its debut with iOS 3.2. That OS' limitations seem prehistoric today. You couldn't bounce between applications with multitasking. You couldn't organize applications into folders. And support for document printing and AirPlay streaming of music, videos, and photos didn't arrive until November 2010.

At launch, the iPad 2 comes with iOS 4.3, bringing a host of important new features and improvements. There are new apps for Photo Booth (a dedicated portrait-taking app), and FaceTime video chat. The Safari Web browser gets a speed boost under the hood for improved JavaScript rendering. The app now includes a Home Sharing option for streaming media over your home network from local computers. And for those of you who want flexible control over the function of the switch above the iPad's volume buttons, iOS 4.3 hands over the reins and allows you to designate it as either a rotation lock or a mute for system alert sounds (such as incoming FaceTime calls).

One sticking point in the original iPad that Apple hasn't addressed in the iPad 2 is Adobe Flash support for Apple's Safari Web browser. Apple seems dead set against supporting Adobe's popular tool for presenting video and graphics on the Web, and without it, many corners of the Web are inaccessible on the iPad or present a Swiss cheese of broken content. For the most part, though, the iPad's Web-browsing experience is the best you'll find on a tablet. Navigation is responsive, zooming in and out of text is fluid, and managing multiple open pages is a cinch.

The iPad's device features, such as Bluetooth 2.1 (A2DP, EDR), Wi-Fi 802.11 n, 3G, and 10 hours of battery life, are all here, and in many cases are still the bar by which other tablets are judged.

Wi-Fi versus 3G

For road warriors or those who just get a little itchy at the idea of not being connected to the Internet, Apple offers a version of the iPad with an integrated 3G cellular data connection.

Aside from a negligible added heft of 0.1 pound and the fact that buyers are paying an extra $130 for the 3G capability (compared with Wi-Fi-only models), there's no downside to owning a 3G-compatible model. Unlike the data plans for most smartphones, the iPad doesn't come with any long-term contractual obligations. If you don't end up using the iPad's 3G capability, you can cancel the data plan at any time.

If you decide to go with the 3G option for the iPad 2, you have your choice of two carriers: AT&T or Verizon. Data plans and fees differ between the two carriers (and are always subject to change), and the 3G cellular technology under the hood differs as well.

The AT&T iPad model uses a GSM modem and a micro-SIM card slot, allowing you to easily swap in compatible micro-SIM cards from foreign carriers when overseas. Verizon's iPad uses a CDMA 3G modem and lacks the SIM-swapping feature of AT&T's GSM modem, making it a poor choice for international jet-setters.

As far as data plans go, AT&T offers two options: $15 a month for 250MB of data, or $25 a month for 2GB. Each option can be prepaid for a month, and AT&T's plans do not include an activation fee.

Verizon's plans are a little steeper, but more generous with data. There's a 1GB plan for $20, 3GB for $35, 5GB for $50, and a whopping 10GB for $80. There's an initial $35 activation fee, however, which you run the chance of paying each time you let your account lapse for over three months.",html

http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/clean-out-junk-files-in-windows-7-8-1-and-10/,"Clean out junk files in Windows 7, 8.1, and 10","October,Pm,Tom Mcnamara",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Software has a way of accumulating on your Windows machine, and for the sake of security, system performance, and disk space, it's a good idea to clear out junk files every so often. Sometimes Windows may make you do an in-place upgrade (which happens frequently for members of the Insider program). This means that the operating system is completely re-installed, but you keep your files and installed programs. A side-effect of this process is a lot of leftover files that you may never use again, including an archived copy of the old Windows build that you just upgraded from. If you find yourself doing one of these upgrades, or if you just want to check for stuff you can get rid of, there are a few easy things you can do that don't require installing special software.

The Disk Cleanup tool

Every storage device in your computer has access to the Disk Cleanup tool. Find it by clicking the Start button, typing ""disk cleanup"" (without the quotes), and clicking the Disk Cleanup shortcut in your search results. (Click and drag this shortcut to your desktop or taskbar for easier access next time.) You can also find the tool by right-clicking a storage device in File Explorer, selecting Properties, and clicking the Disk Cleanup button to the right of the pie chart.

Sometimes the shortcut doesn't show up in your search results. If this is the case, instead of typing ""disk cleanup,"" type ""free up disk space"" (without the quotes). A phrase may work when the name of the program doesn't.

If you have a lot of stuff to clean up, it may take the tool several minutes to analyze your situation and get your cruft organized for deletion. Once that's done, you'll get a new window listing separate deletable elements. Some boxes are pre-checked, such as the one next to Temporary Internet Files.

Browser and thumbnail caches

Browser and thumbnail caches can consume several gigabytes if you use Internet Explorer or Edge as your main browser. When you load a webpage, it gets stored here for quicker access later, so cleaning out the cache can make future browsing slower.

Chrome and Firefox caches get cleaned from within those apps through a menu accessed by pressing Ctrl-Shift-Del when the browser is open. This shortcut also works for IE and Edge, and it's preferable to do it within the browser, since you can elect to keep things like cookies and passwords while deleting everything else. (Microsoft Edge is exclusive to Windows 10, so don't be alarmed if you can't find it in Windows 7 or 8.1.)

Since you're likely to reuse the contents of the cache on a regular basis, and it will gradually bloat up again, you may not want to clear the cache unless you're uninstalling the browser. You might also want to clear cache if you have security concerns -- an unauthorized user who gets access to the device can access these caches and possibly extract private information.

The Thumbnails item is for all the small images that File Explorer creates when you tell it to display media files using the icon view. Pictures and videos don't have thumbnails by default, so Windows generates them. As a result, the Thumbnails category in the Disk Cleanup tool can grow over time. But if you clear it out, Windows will have to re-generate those images the next time you view a folder that's set to view by icons. Each thumbnail can take a second to create, which adds up if you're a photographer or videographer. So we recommend leaving the Thumbnails item in Disk Cleanup unchecked, unless its size is creating issues.

System files

The biggest hoarders of your disk space are probably system files, so click the ""Clean up system files"" button to access them. This will perform another analysis, which can take a few minutes, especially if it detects Windows Update items that can be cleaned up. Then it will load a window that looks exactly like the analysis results window you saw in Disk Cleanup. This time, however, there are additional items in the list. If you're using Windows 7, you may find several gigabytes of Service Pack Backup Files listed. In theory, this archive can be used to undo a service pack.

Windows Update Cleanup also frequently has several gigabytes of files you can delete. These are the update files themselves, which Windows may archive for easier access later, if needed. Checking boxes next to these and clicking the OK button will delete all these files. If you do that, however, keep in mind that Windows may not be able to roll back to the older versions of the system files that the updates have changed, unless you made an external backup image of your C: drive first. And unfortunately you can't pick which Update Cleanup files you want to keep -- it's all or nothing.

System Restore

Windows uses System Restore to preserve system files in case they're accidentally deleted or corrupted. A system restore is like a bookmark or snapshot that the operating system can go back to. It's not a full backup, so it may not help you if you can't boot Windows at all, but Windows 7 makes periodic bookmarks that can end up using a lot of space. In Windows 8.1 and 10, System Restore is disabled by default, so you shouldn't need to mess with its settings unless you've enabled the feature yourself.

Unfortunately, Windows doesn't let you choose which restore points you want to keep, nor does it easily tell you how much disk space your restore points are taking up. The Disk Cleanup tool lets you delete all but the most recent one.

To do so, go to the Disk Cleanup tool. Click ""Clean up system files,"" click the More Options tab, go down to the System Restore and Shadow Copies section, click the Clean Up button, and click the Delete button to confirm.

To delete the most recent restore point as well, you need a different tool. Click the Start menu button, right-click Computer, select Properties, click the System Protection link on the left-hand side, and click the Configure button to access your System Restore settings. If you don't have a Computer shortcut on your Start menu or your desktop, click the Start button, type ""computer"" without the quotes to get it to come up in your search results, right-click it, select Properties, and you will be at the window where you click System Protection. Then click Configure.

You can disable System Restore altogether, tell Windows what percentage of disk space you want to dedicate to System Restore, and click the Delete button to delete all restore points. This window also shows you how much space your System Restore points are taking up. By default, Windows 7 sets aside about 5 percent of your Windows drive for restore points.

Hibernation cache

When you turn off your device, Windows stores the programs you're running and your open files in a large file, the hibernation cache. Sleep mode, by contrast, keeps this material in your system RAM and puts the device in a low-power mode. Hibernation mode doesn't draw battery power, but it takes longer to boot up than restoring from sleep mode, which is more or less instant. Unless you're using a mobile device that has trouble with battery life, you can usually disable hibernation, and the storage space that you save is roughly equal to the amount of system RAM.

To do so, click the Start button, type ""cmd"" (without the quotes), right-click cmd.exe, select Run as Administrator, and click Yes to confirm. This is the Windows command prompt. Paste the ""powercfg.exe /hibernate off"" (without the quotes) into the command prompt. Ctrl-V doesn't work here, though. Instead, you have to right-click in the window and select Paste. Then hit Enter. If you want to re-enable hibernation mode later, paste ""powercfg.exe /hibernate off"" without the quotes. The change will take effect immediately.

The Recycle Bin

When you delete a file, Windows doesn't erase it by default. The file just goes to the Recycle Bin, where it will stay until you tell Windows to empty the bin. So the bin needs to be checked periodically to make sure your disk space isn't being used up by things that you no longer need.

You can also adjust how the Recycle Bin behaves. To do so, open the File Explorer (press Windows-E), find the bin in the left-hand pane, right-click it, and select Properties. The bin might not be displayed by default, in which case you need to right-click the left-hand pane and select Show All Folders.

In the Recycle Bin properties window, you can tell Windows the maximum amount of space you want to use for the bin. The default is 5 percent of your C: drive's storage capacity, and you can increase that to 10 percent. You can also tell Windows to skip the bin altogether, as well as disable the confirmation prompt that pops up when you attempt to delete a file. When you're done making your changes, click OK.

Automating system cleanup

We said at the beginning that you don't need special software to do any of this, but it can save you time. CCleaner is the go-to third-party tool for disk cleanup. It will analyze your system in a few seconds, itemize what that you can clean out, and delete it all with a click. Since it cleans out browser caches and other potentially useful items by default, you should tweak it to make sure that it's deleting the actual junk and not things that you might reuse later.",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20088480-12/security-insider-discusses-vistas-level-of-security/,Security insider discusses Vista's level of security,"August,Pm,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"LAS VEGAS--It's easy now to look back at Microsoft's Windows Vista and berate the company for the operating system's shortcomings, but the truth is far more complex, according to one security researcher. At the second day of the annual Black Hat conference here, Chris Paget, chief hacker at the security company Recursion Ventures, discussed her independent contracting work for Microsoft on Vista prior to its release for the first time. Before Recursion took on the contract, all members of the team that worked on Vista were made to sign non-disclosure agreements that took five years to expire.

(Credit: Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Microsoft hired her team as a final measure to verify that the operating system was safe to ship. The move was so unusual for Redmond that the company had actually never done it before, said Paget. ""There were process and tool improvements. This was the first time that Microsoft brought in an outside team,"" she said.

Her team had to upgrade the hard drive of the test computer that Microsoft sent her before they could even install the operating system, she said with a slightly incredulous laugh. The process was so atypical for Microsoft that they weren't sure what to expect. ""They expected us to come in and find nothing. This was the final check.""

Recursion looked at code kernel and the user space but was told not to look at legacy code. Microsoft didn't add legacy code vetting until Windows 7, Paget said. ""They got verification, not remediation."" She said that her team was so good at finding critical flaws in Vista code that Vista was actually delayed because of one critical bug she found, and another Microsoft employee referred to them as a ""rape gang"" because they were beating up Vista so much.

Despite the security problems that Paget and company discovered in Vista, she also had high praise for Microsoft. She discussed Microsoft's bug track system and how Microsoft's own security team had created an extensive list of features ranked by risk. Risk, she said, was defined as whether the feature required credentials. If you had to enter a password, like an administrative password, there was a greater risk naturally associated with the feature. So because of Microsoft's work on this end, she was able to begin looking at features critically from beginning of the contract.

The experience, she said, showed her that by the time Microsoft had far better procedures in place for security vetting than she would have thought otherwise. Paget said that at home, she's more of a Unix fan and only uses Windows for gaming. ""I would dearly love to see a Windows Lite, with all the unmaintained code removed.""

""'World-leading' is entirely appropriate"" when discussing Microsoft's security procedures, she said at the start of her talk. ""Microsoft's security process is spectacular."" And toward the end, she reiterated the point. ""If security is a process, not a product, Microsoft deserves a lot of credit. Vista was a giant leap in the right direction.""",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20007842-12.html,"New Flock divorces Firefox, snuggles up to Chrome","June,Am,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Flock made its name as a Firefox remix that came loaded with custom add-ons for tightly integrating social networking with daily Web browsing. Just opened to the public, the Flock 3 beta keeps its social goals intact while replacing its Firefox base with Google-supported Chromium. The new Flock experience is vastly different than before, and is related to the old version in name only.

It's currently available only for Windows, although Flock CEO Shawn Hardin said in an interview two weeks ago at the CNET offices in San Francisco that a Mac beta should be ready in July. The new Flock strips the social networking support down to Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Flickr. By limiting initial support to the two dominant social networking players and the two dominant media-sharing sites, but making access to them fast and generally comprehensive, the new Flock is able to demonstrate why it's useful without overwhelming users.

Minor interface changes belie the significant changes in how Flock operates. Being based on WebKit, it looks similar to Google Chrome and Apple Safari. The tabs aren't flush with the top of the browser as they are in Chrome, and the new home page is set to your Flock account manager. There's a big Google search box in the middle of the page, which is part of a new search monetization partnership between the two companies, and text links to your most-recently visited sites. At the top, just below the bookmarks bar, there are links to the Flock-enhanced features favorites and groups.

In addition to the repurposing of the Home button and the Flockification of Favorites, there are three other changes. Next to the Favorites button there's a new ""Talk about this page"" button that instantly shrinks the URL and lets you share it via Facebook and Twitter. On the other side of the location bar, the split preferences buttons have been merged into one to create room for a hide button for the new sidebar.

When you launch the new Flock, it'll ask you to add your Facebook and Twitter login details. You can opt out, but there's no point to Flock if you're not using it for social networking. You must also create a Flock account to take advantage of the social networking tools. This allows you to access your Flock settings from any Flock browser, but it does carry the standard risks of remote ""cloud"" storage.

Once you're set up, it will automatically open with its new sidebar open. Situated on the right, this sidebar marks the first Chromium sidebar, according to Hardin. More importantly for users, the sidebar becomes the social networking nexus in the new Flock by creating a stream of your friends' updates.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Built mostly in HTML5, the sidebar itself is fairly configurable and feels lightweight. There's a button at the top to hide it, and it moves quickly. The immediate function of the sidebar is to let you read and reply to updates without leaving the page you're on, but it does much more. The friends stream comes with a broad range of filters to make it easy to see only the updates that you need. Not only can you limit it to Facebook only or Twitter only, but you can also narrow each of those streams further. You can slim Twitter down to direct messages only or new tweets only. Facebook can be put on a major diet, too, including limiting Facebook updates to status-only or filtering out wall posts.

Flock supports multiple accounts from the same service, but you're only allowed to be signed into multiple Twitter accounts simultaneously. Users can also create groups of friends, and filter the stream by them, too. Two group titles come with Flock, Best Friends and Co-workers, but the browser leaves it to you to fill them out. This can be done by hitting the Edit button at the bottom of the list, or through the Groups tab on the Flock home page. Filling them out will give you a pretty good hands-on tutorial on how to create your own groups.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

There's a strong HTML5 bent to how to you do things in Flock 3. You can drag and drop friends to reorganize them, or click on them and then choose an action. Flock does not yet automatically merge contacts, although Hardin said that was feature is planned for later this summer. For now, you can drag and drop contacts to merge them into a single identity.

In general, the new minor features work well, although that's not always true. Unlike Chrome, Flock supports RSS feeds out of the box. It also lets you Favorite the feed itself, and the new Flock makes sharing those favorites much easier than in other browsers. You can toggle a Favorited item as being public or private, or opt-in to setting your Flock profile page to public to provide a single space for your Favorited items to land on.

The ""Talk about this page"" button for Facebooking or Twittering a page is a long-overdue browser feature that obviates copying and pasting. The ""superbar"" approach to the location bar, where default search engine searches are combined with history and bookmark searches, has been bolstered by Flock-specific matches from your friends.

However, it does come with a bucketload of news-related bookmarks in the bookmark bar. It's not clear why and it adds an unnecessary amount of clutter, basically rendering the bar useless unless you clean it out first. Similarly, the unified options menu to the right of the location bar might overwhelm some users.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

The beta felt fairly stable over a day and a half of testing, although installing it did feel slower than other browsers. Once loaded, there were no noticeable hang-ups.

Flock has seen impressive growth in the past year, much of it coming from Facebook users, according to Hardin. He said that 87 percent of people who've recommended Flock on Facebook have recommended it to six or more friends, and that it's the most popular Facebook-managing desktop app. The browser is the sixth most-popular browser in Europe, he added, behind the five major players of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera. Through May 2010, Flock took about 0.07 percent of the global market, a tiny number but rapidly growing according to the graph.

What this all means for Flock's relationship with Mozilla isn't as clear as you'd expect. Flock will continue to support the Mozilla-based branch of the browser, and anticipates releasing version 2.6 soon. Flock has had a relationship with Mozilla for five years, said Hardin, and he added that no decision has been made yet about severing it.

Originally, Flock's success appeared to be dictated by the willingness of users to take a performance hit in order to gain its robust social networking features. The new Flock 3 beta reduces the overall feature set while providing more focused features, and anecdotal performance hits weren't noticeable. Assuming the browser can maintain its nimble behavior, the big question about Flock is whether users want the utility and distraction of always-on social networking.",html

In celebration of the MLB home-run derby and all-star game this week, developer's Com2uS have decided to have a 1-day sale on their extremely popular game Baseball Slugger 3D (usually $2.99). You can get the game today for only 99 cents and, after having played the game, I can tell you it is definitely more than worth the money.

I had initially passed over this title because I already bought Gamevil's Baseball Superstars 2009 (another great baseball game). But instead of playing a complete baseball game, Baseball Slugger 3D is all about competing in the home-run derby either for your personal high score, or against other players online.

(Credit: CNET)

The control system is excellent--tilt your iPhone or iPod Touch to adjust where you will swing in the strike zone. When the pitch crosses the plate, touch the screen anywhere to swing. It takes some practice to be able to line up your bat with different types of pitches, but you get the hang of it fairly quickly. The challenge is in hitting several home runs in a row, which you'll need to practice if you plan on trying your luck against other skilled players online. I should also point out, the system for online matching with other players is superb, letting you start playing almost immediately. As you play, you can even see how your opponent is doing with a picture-in-picture display in the upper-right part of your screen.

Even if you have only a passing interest in baseball, Baseball Slugger 3D is so well-made that it would be worth the money at its regular price of $2.99. But for 99 cents, this home run hitter is a no-brainer with good-looking 3D graphics, customizable uniforms, great controls, and seamless online gameplay.",html

Platforms: Windows, Mac, Android, iOS

Price: $80 per year or $8 per month

It's important to back up your entire hard drive, but sometimes you just want copies of your documents, photos, and other media. You also want access to your files anywhere, on any device. That's why so many of us have turned to online data backup. You may already use Google Drive or Apple iCloud, which are convenient but have some limitations. It may be worth spending a little money to use another service (and to keep your data separate from your other Google or Apple stuff).

We evaluated a long list of cloud backup services, and SOS Online Backup has won our top recommendation. When choosing a cloud service, you have to look at pricing, payment options, OS compatibility, and the geographic location of the servers. But when you're putting your personal data online, the most important factor is who has access to it. Ideally, only you do. But most of the cloud backup services that we checked out keep a copy of your decryption keys, including Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox, and OneDrive.

SOS Online Backup is on a short list of services that offer optional client-side encryption, so that only you -- and not the service or anyone else -- can decrypt and view your data. Some services that use client-side encryption won't even give you a password reset option; SOS is one of them. If you're serious about your privacy, you should use a password manager instead for password changes. Client-side encryption is important enough to the security of your personal data that we actually disqualified the cloud backup services that didn't at least offer it as an optional feature.

On top of its privacy protections, SOS offers unlimited storage for a reasonable fee, unlimited optional retention of deleted files, unlimited file versions, continuous file syncing, and direct data backup from Android devices. Unfortunately, iOS users can't back up more than contacts and photos, but they can still access and download their data in the cloud. SOS Online Backup doesn't tick that particular box, but we think it's the most complete package and your best backup option.

More cloud services for data backup

Carbonite Personal

Platforms: Windows, Mac, Android, iOS

Price: $60 per year for unlimited storage or $100 per year with local backup

Pros: Unlimited storage, low price, free 15-day trial, optional courier service (Carbonite will hand-deliver an encrypted drive containing your data), and a hybrid option where you can use an external drive to mirror your cloud data.

Cons: 4GB file-size limit; client-side encryption available only with the Windows desktop client; no monthly payment option.

Bottom Line: Unlimited storage space for $60 a year is very nice, but the low file-size limit is a puzzling deal-breaker.

MozyHome

Platforms: Windows, Mac, Android, iOS

Price: $6 per month for 50GB for one user, or $10 per month for 125GB and up to three users

Pros: Optional client-side encryption; local backup; 24/7 live support; scalable storage space and number of users; free 2GB account that gets 256MB more per referral.

Cons: High cost per gigabyte.

Bottom Line: MozyHome's 24/7 support and low storage capacity are good if your backup needs are basic, but users who need more will need another service.

Backblaze

Platforms: Windows, Mac, Android, iOS

Price: $50 per year or $5 per month, per user, for unlimited storage

Pros: Inexpensive; local backup available; optional client-side encryption; continuous backups; 15-day trial; strong password support.

Cons: Deleted files are retained for just 30 days.

Bottom Line: Backblaze is a strong runner-up, held back only by its file-deletion policy.

Crashplan

Platforms:Windows, Mac, iOS, Android

Price: $60 per year or $6 per month, per user, for unlimited storage

Pros: Unlimited storage; optional client-side encryption; local backup, which is also available as a separate free service; courier service; and seed service, where Crashplan mails you a drive that you mail back with your data on it.

Cons: File sync requires signing up for another service that doubles the cost; no third-party payment options.

Bottom Line: Breaking sync into a separate product is an odd choice. The lack of PayPal or another third-party payment option reduces privacy.

Bitcasa

Platforms:Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS

Price: $10 per month for 1TB for 5 users

Pros: You can stream media directly from the cloud and share individual files; free 5GB account available for up to three users; extensive support documentation; Linux client.

Cons: Price is on the high side; no local storage option; client-side encryption is mandatory rather than optional.

Bottom Line: Streaming and sharing are nice features, but you can get more storage for less, and password recovery can be a hassle when you're using client-side encryption.

SpiderOak

Platforms:Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android

Price: $80 per year or $7 per month for 50GB; $130 per year for 1TB

Pros: Hybrid option; 60-day trial available (but limited to 2GB).

Cons: Client-side encryption is mandatory; password recovery uses hints.

Bottom Line: Emailing a password-reset link is more reliable than a hint and less prone to people using their password as their hint. Also, SpiderOak's prices are on the high side.

pCloud

Platforms:Windows, Mac, iOS, Android

Price: $10 per month for 1TB, per user

Pros: Free 10GB account available, expanding to 20GB with referrals; 10-day money-back guarantee.

Cons: Client-side encryption costs $4 more per month and is only available on the Windows desktop client; no annual subscription options.

Bottom Line: We like that client-side encryption is optional, but the service gets relatively pricey with it.

Jungle Disk

Platforms:Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS

Price: $4 per month for 10GB, then 15 cents per additional GB

Pros: Scalable storage costs; you can stream media from the cloud.

Cons: No free trial; base cost is high.

Bottom Line: While we like the idea of paying only for the storage that you use, you can get this amount of storage for free from pCloud, and the price of scaling up isn't very competitive.

Apple CEO Steve Jobs today announced an online cloud storage service called iCloud that's designed to make it simple to wirelessly share music, e-mail, photos, calendars, and other data between handheld gadgets and desktop computers.

The new Apple service, which has been the subject of intense speculation for more than a year, attempts to harness the power and flexibility of cloud computing for home users. It uses techniques that have already proved popular with businesses to make it easier to move data stored on Apple's servers back and forth between multiple devices and applications.

Jobs introduced iCloud this morning at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco as part of a broader announcement that also highlighted the forthcoming version of Mac OS X Lion, available in July for $29.99, and new features for iOS including a newsstand and tabbed browsing on the iPad.

iCloud represents a direct challenge to Google's cloud-based offerings, which already use services like Gmail, Calendar, Picasa, and Google Docs to let users see and edit the same document or photo across multiple devices. In addition, Google recently announced Google Music and, in March, Amazon.com unveiled Amazon Cloud Drive.

Apple

About 10 years ago, Jobs said, Apple experienced one of its most important insights: The PC would become the digital hub for your digital life and store photos, video, and music, which would in turn be synchronized with mobile devices plugged in to it. Now, he said, his company is at a similar turning point, where iCloud can store data and wirelessly push it to every device you own.

iCloud will be supported by new versions of applications including Calendar, Mail, and Contacts, so if information is changed for one contact, the new data goes to Apple's servers and is then pushed to the other devices. Cloud backup is another part of the service, including daily wireless backup of an iOS device. Third-party apps can also store documents in the cloud through new interfaces that will be made available to developers. Everyone gets 5GB of free storage on Apple's servers for mail, documents, and backup purposes, but purchased music or books don't count toward that limit.

Music, on the other hand, is singled out for special restrictions. Apple says that only music bought ""from iTunes"" can be transferred to the cloud and shared with other devices--a fact that's been previously reported and may limit iCloud's allure for music aficionados who have transferred gigabytes of music from legally purchased CDs to their computers.

Apple's answer to that is ""iTunes Match,"" which allows users to store their ""entire collection,"" including music ripped from CDs, on iCloud servers for $24.99 a year. It works by analyzing songs in your collection, comparing them against the 18 million songs in the iTunes Store, and then making those available immediately at 256 kbps, even if the originals were lower quality.

In an exclusive story in January 2010, CNET reported that Apple executives began disclosing a streaming media service with the top four music labels. Then, last month, CNET reported Apple had signed a cloud-music licensing agreement with EMI Music and was very near to completing deals with Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment. At the moment, iTunes enjoys a dominant role in digital music, with Apple accounting for more than 70 percent of all digital-song sales. The iTunes music store has become the largest music retailer, online or offline.

You can also optionally have songs that you buy downloaded to all of your other devices or computers. Eddy Cue, Apple's vice president of Internet services, demonstrated this--to applause--by buying a song on an iPhone and having it pop up on an iPad a moment later.

One of the apps that will be central to iCloud, Jobs said, is Documents, which keeps files in sync across multiple devices by pushing the updates. (The updates that went out last week for the iPad and iPhone versions of iWork secretly had this feature included, he said.)

Another app is called PhotoStream, which promises to take your entire digital camera roll to the cloud. It includes photos you've taken, as well as photos that have been imported to the camera roll through something like Apple's camera accessory. It will use iPhoto on the Mac, the Pictures directory under Windows, and be integrated into Apple TV. (On iOS, the most recent 1,000 photos are stored.)

You can sign up on Apple.com to be notified when iCloud becomes available.",html

For starters, it's portable freeware. Free is good, and portability adds flexibility: You can take WriteMonkey along with you on a USB drive and run it on any handy Windows machine. Zenware notes that WriteMonkey has ""an extremely stripped-down user interface,"" but that's what sets it apart from other word processors and notekeepers. That ""stripped-down,"" full-screen interface replicates the inspirational purity of a blank piece of paper. But WriteMonkey is also a full-featured writing tool that doesn't cut corners and even packs lots of cool extras, such as simulated typewriter sounds for the total effect (you provide the leather elbow patches). WriteMonkey receives frequent upgrades and new features. Recent updates include better performance on Netbooks and Windows 8 compatibility.

WriteMonkey is portable freeware that runs when you click the extracted program file and without having to be installed, though its extensive documentation includes several notes about ""installing"" the program, which involves copying or moving the extracted program folder to the destination of your choice, and updating it, which involves overwriting existing files. WriteMonkey opened with a blank white page in Letter proportions, labeled Scratch, and displaying discreet word and time counters. The old-school font's typeface looks like it came straight off of a mechanical typewriter. But right-click WriteMonkey's page and you'll call up a menu with no fewer than ... well, a whole lot of entries; everything from setup, options, and basic commands to unique features like the Jumps Window, which serves as a central navigation window for files, folders, bookmarks, and just about anything in WriteMonkey. Plenty of assistance is available, too. The Help Card assembles all of WriteMonkey's hotkey shortcuts and markup rules in a highly visible, white-on-black pop-up. Features like Spell Check, Italics, and Export Markup are a click or two away. The Lookups menu's fast reference links are practically indispensable.

We've used WriteMonkey for years now, and its minimalist look actually helps reduce distractions, though the draggable minimized window might be better suited for everyday use like note-taking. For us, its intuitive features and Zen-like purity keeps WriteMonkey ""always on top.""",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20115068-12/avira-12s-got-new-threads-install-and-engines/,"Avira 12's got new threads, install, and engines","October,Am,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"After several years of minor changes that were touted as big improvements, Avira today released a new version with some serious heft behind it that the publisher hopes will position the free antivirus for future growth. Avira Free Antivirus 12, available exclusively today from CNET Download.com, along with the paid upgrades Avira Antivirus Premium 12 and Avira Internet Security 12, bring a new interface, tighter security engines, and an impressively zippy installation process to the suites.

The new installation is much improved and is among the fastest out there. The company says that it developed the two-click installation as part of its ""less is more"" strategy, where it offers the same level of protection as before without the hassle. Of course, that's a tacit acknowledgement of prior problems.

Anyway, the new install is the simplest of the major free security suites. The two-click process will auto-detect competing security components and remove them, so be warned if you think you're going to be more secure by running two overlapping AVs. Avira won't let you. Another click will take you past the Ask.com toolbar and search engine re-direct, but at least Avira is polite: it's an opt-in, not opt-out, experience. The toolbar screen itself is a bit unclear: it's actually Avira's WebGuard feature, powered by an Ask.com search engine that's part of the toolbar. There's also an option to have Ask.com become your browser's default engine, although that's not checked by default.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Like many competitors, the WebGuard takes a more aggressive approach to detecting sites that could be hosting malware before they load on your computer. However, for the performance cost to the browser for a toolbar, search result ratings would be a nice compensation. Too bad they're not offered.

Avira runs a quick scan when you first install it to ensure that your system is clean. It took about one minute 25 seconds on my test machine. A full scan run immediately afterward took 96 minutes to complete, which is about average for that kind of scan. The engine powering the scans has been improved, too. Your Hosts file is protected by default, and resource usage has been slashed. And after the daily virus definition file update, Avira still takes over your screen with a pop-up asking you to upgrade.

The company told me that it kept it because its users like it. According to their market research feedback, the pop-up apparently reminds people that they've been protected. Be that as it may, I find it an unnecessary distraction that blocks me once a day from doing something more important than clicking away an ad.

CNET Labs noted some impressive scores from Avira, which performed at average or better in nearly every category we looked at. Details will be made available in the full review of Avira Free Antivirus 12, which will publish later today.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

The new interface is simple and mimics that of many competitors. A left nav shows you your tools, while the center pane focuses on a deeper dive into your security. New on-off buttons make it easy to toggle features, although it's noteworthy that the free version is quite restricted when compared with the free competition. No doubt, this is the easiest-to-use version of Avira yet.

Features-wise, the free version provides the kind of security that most people will be comfortable with. For people who want more, Avira Antivirus Premium 12 ($29.99 for a one-year license) comes with a suspicious behavior guard for when programs or files that might be trusted act in an unsecure manner; the silent/gaming mode for fullscreen use; and live telephone support. Avira Internet Security 12 ($49.99 for a one-year license) rolls in parental controls; an e-mail spam guard; anti-phishing measures; and a firewall that I found to be obnoxiously chatty and intrusive.

Longtime Avira fans will note that the suites also have undergone a bit of a name change. The product title ""AntiVir"" has been dropped, as Avira AntiVir Personal becomes Avira Free Antivirus, Avira AntiVir Premium becomes Avira Antivirus Premium, and Avira Premium Security Suite becomes Avira Internet Security. While product-specific names may work for some companies because of legacy associations, such as the Norton product from Symantec, new user confusion has likely forced security suite makers to streamline their operations.

Avira has had a mixed record on false positives, although recent tests indicate it's getting better on that front. However, there's no doubt that as a free product, it offers less than the competitors, and not for a truly heightened level of security. If you like Avira, I'd say you're fine to stick with it. But if you're not happy, it wouldn't hurt to look elsewhere.",html
http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/first-look-os-x-el-capitan-public-beta,First look: OS X El Capitan public beta,"July,Pm,Clifford Col",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"The waiting is the hardest part, and Apple knows it. Which may be why the company is making available a public beta of its next major update to OS X, named El Capitan, in anticipation of its final release this fall.

Apple first gave us a glimpse of El Capitan in June at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference and this month offered a prerelease version to the public, allowing users to check out the progress of the upcoming OS. According to Apple, El Capitan is very much about refining the look and feel of OS X, from how you work with apps and search to how quickly apps open and display information.

Split View

For example, Split View is new in El Capitan and lets you fill your screen with two side-by-side app windows. That's a nice addition for when you are working on two documents, and it means you don't have to resize windows to fit next each other or click back and forth between app windows. To use Split View, click, hold, and then release the green full-screen button in a window's title bar to select your first window. Then in Mission Control, select your second window.

Mission Control

Mission Control gives you a quick way to see, arrange, and navigate between your open windows. In El Capitan, Mission Control gathers related windows together, so you can easily find a window associated with an app.

Spotlight

With El Capitan's Spotlight, you can get search results for sports, stocks, transit, and weather, as well as Web videos. And you can type your queries using natural language, so you shouldn't have to think too hard about how to phrase your questions to get the results you want.

Mail

Apple continues to polish its Mail app. In the update, swipe to mark an email as read or unread or to delete it. Mail also includes Smart Suggestions, a feature that looks for names and events in messages and prompts you to add them to your contacts or calendar.

Notes

The Notes apps gets a big boost in El Capitan. You can now drag photos, PDFs, videos, and other files into a note and save content -- such as a website or a map -- from other apps through the Share menu. It's also easy to create checklists. And the app does a nice job of working with iCloud, so your notes are synced across your Apple devices.

Photos

Photos, which formally replaced iPhoto earlier this spring, becomes more useful in El Capitan. You can add third-party editing extensions to the app, you can add location information to an image or an entire Moment, and you can sort albums by title and name as well as by date.

Safari

El Capitan's Safari lets you pin your your favorite websites on the browser's tab bar. Mute audio from a noisy tab with a mute button in the search field. To pin a tab, go up to Safari's Window menu and select Pin Tab.

Maps

Maps in El Capitan now has a Transit view that provides guidance for using a city's public transportation system. However, the public beta has transit info for a just a handful of cities. So I can get around the Bay Area, but if I search for a city without transit info, I get a message telling me information is not available.

Under the hood

Apple says it's working behind the scenes to make El Capitan feel snappier and more fluid. From faster app launching to quicker display of your first messages in Mail, Apple's focus is on making El Capitan more responsive. While it's tough to judge performance improvements in betas, with so many moving parts, the public beta feels solid and responsive.

A note of caution

Beta software can be finicky, with unexpected behavior and app incompatibilities. If you decide to install the public beta of El Capitan, take care: make you sure you have a current backup of everything and consider running the beta on a secondary machine or external hard drive, definitely not on your primary one.",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-10225494-12.html,"Norton Online Family to leave beta, remain free","April,Pm,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Editors' note: In the original version of this blog, we used the beta name for this product. The official name is OnlineFamily.Norton.

Back in February, Symantec debuted a new security program that sought to help parents talk to their kids about how they use the Internet. OnlineFamily.Norton has been a free beta since then, but this Monday at midnight, the program will leave beta and remain free at least until the end of 2009. The program was originally called Norton Family Online.

(Credit: Symantec)

This parental control suite provides parents with an interesting and possibly unique approach to online child safety. OnlineFamily.Norton does provide a blacklist, boilerplate for most parental control software. However, the suite offers more than just an On/Off switch, and provides tools that encourage communication between parents and their children.

There's a wide range of control over what sites a child can access. The restrictions can vary from a strict no-access policy that can block specific sites and site categories, to a more lenient notification e-mail sent to the parents when the child visits sites that parents merely want to be warned about. On the child's side, kids are given the option of e-mailing their parents when they're blocked--if the parents allow those e-mails in the first place.

Jody Gibney, product manager for OnlineFamily.Norton, said, ""We want to encourage a different philosophical approach, encouraging parents to talk to kids instead of setting up an adversarial relationship."" To further that, the program's House Rules can be customized to suit the needs of individual children within each family, a useful feature since a teenager will have different browsing and social-networking interests than an 8-year-old.

(Credit: Symantec)

It's impossible for a kid not to know that OnlineFamily.Norton is running on their computer's background, since it warns them that it's activated. The log-in process requires that the Norton Safety Minder for Windows and Mac be installed first. The program allows kids to view the House Rules independently of their parents. Parents, on the other hand, are able to see what sites their children have been visiting, including search results for terms the child has queried.

However, the program doesn't provide ""reams and reams of information,"" as Gibney put it. ""We want to provide [parents] with enough information to start a discussion without overwhelming them."" The program will flag social-network profile inconsistencies, such as discrepancies in a child's stated age or name, for example.

The differences between the beta and the free version are apparently limited to interface enhancements designed to streamline the setup process and provide better access to the information that OnlineFamily.Norton collects. The free version will be available at midnight on Monday. A one-year subscription starting January 1, 2010, is expected to cost $60.",html

Mozilla's second Firefox 4 beta debuted on Tuesday, with interface and feature improvements for Windows and Mac users, and under-the-hood changes that include faster browser launch times. Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, Firefox 4 beta 2 doesn't make any radical visual changes to the browser, but it does introduce a couple of new features and support for new developer tools.

The only interface change made this time around was to give Mac users the tabs on top look by default. Windows users received that feature in the first beta. This can still be reverted under Preferences. Linux users have yet to receive tabs on top by default.

One of the big features that some users have been anticipating in Firefox 4 is App Tabs, analogous to Google Chrome's Pin Tab feature. It reduces a tab to its favicon, and then anchors it permanently on the left side of the tab bar. This can make it easier to find regularly frequented sites, such as Web mail or a calendar. To create an App Tab, right-click on a tab and choose, ""Make into an App Tab."" One of the principal designers on Firefox, Alex Faaborg, has created a video that details how to use the App Tabs. He also notes that App Tabs will receive some kind of special treatment in the upcoming Tab Candy feature.

How Firefox 4 functions and handles the code that powers the Web has changed slightly, too. The biggest change, made to the XPCOM registration, has the potential to break a lot of components that interact with Firefox. While that could result in a lot of headaches over the near future, users should see faster Firefox start-up times in the long run.

Meanwhile, part of the CSS3 Transformations, called Transitions, are now supported in Firefox 4. This means that developers will be able to build content that animates instead of effecting an immediate change. Curious readers can check out the yellow box demo on the Mozilla Hacks blog. Support for retained layers also shipped in the second beta, which allows for faster page scrolling.

Mozilla also noted that user comments sent via the ""feedback"" button on the right-hand side of the navigation bar helped the publisher fix more than 670 issues in the first beta. Future betas promise to include new features such as the aforementioned Tab Candy and the redesigned add-on framework, currently code-named JetPack, but also to resolve unsettled debates such as whether to remove the Status Bar and the struggle to improve the browser's overall site-rendering speed.",html

[Laughs] Right away you've hit the bull's-eye. That's a hard question to answer. I don't know. What are people going to think when some guy with a guitar interferes with Brian Wilson? [Laughs] Brian has got a bunch of songs and I come in and change it to a slightly different direction and there's a lot of drama and dynamics.

Do you use an iPad or iPhone?

No. I've got a laptop and that's it.

Do you ever use any software on your laptop?

No. I use my music library and that's it. I don't want to buy into GarageBand or anything like that. I know that other people do, but it's not good to be self-indulgent with the music. I like people in the room with me and having fun in the way that it's traditionally always been -- people playing music with one another and conversing through music. I don't want to create a distance between the music and me.

Speaking of distance, when people go to shows now, it seems like there's a chasm created between the fans and the artist as soon as the former whip out their phones to post comments about or photographs from the shows for Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram or record them for later viewing or to share online. As the artist, how do you feel when that happens?

I hate it. Why don't they just enjoy what's going on rather than having to see it again on a pissy little iPhone? It's this inability to interact with one another, I think. People don't even want to go shopping anymore, so they press a button to get their underwear and they deliver them the next day.

And it's annoying when someone's not looking at you, when they're looking at a viewfinder in a camera. I think we should force people to dump their iPhones in a basket in the beginning and we'll get their name, address, and phone number; and if they're lucky, they'll get them back after the show.

I think it's ridiculous. It's the gathering of people for an event where everyone's supposed to be of one accord and enjoy it. You go around London and you have a million people taking photographs of things and not looking at them. They're not enjoying the moment and the same thing happens during the concert.

I read that you've grown more fond of Irish music in the recent past. How do you discover new music?

Through very close friends, or from working with young, talented players like Imogen Heap. You talk to them...and the more you talk and the more you get together, it's like the old days. Rather than using all this new media stuff, the best stuff comes from people's appreciation of one another. The immediacy of playing in a room with someone can't be equaled.

What are your thoughts on people using their iPads to tune guitars or play/record music? Does that just sound insane to you?

No, it doesn't. But it all started from a simple $20 drum machine, what keyboard players in bar lounges were using to accompany themselves, and then you have a bass line and it gave access to people who couldn't play, which is good; but unfortunately the music became clinical, digital nonsense, with very little skill attached to it.

It's sad because you've got to learn, you've got to practice, and do your damn work if you want to be great; and a lot of the music now has nothing to do with fine artistry, in my opinion, because technology has stomped all over it. But that said, there are players out there who know better, like Imogen Heap, and those are the ones that I look for.

There was a time where most performances became inaccessible, as soon as they occurred. Now with so much being available on Vimeo or YouTube, they can be relived forever. Do you ever watch your old performances?

No, I can't bear to watch a recent performance [Laughs], never mind a past one. I'm afraid Buddy Guy helped me into this situation by astonishing me. He said he never listens to his albums. He preferred not to know what they sound like. He just went by, when they're released, whether people liked them or not. From that point on, I took a page out of that book and never watch myself if I can avoid it. Unless there's reason to, after I perform I couldn't care less about it again, and I just go on.

Do you see why people are such huge fans of your guitar playing?

No. [Laughs] I can't really say that.

There are all these recent interviews where Rod Stewart said that he would love to reunite The Jeff Beck Group, but there's no way you would sign on.

Is that what he said? Because I did do some demos for him and spent $22,000 in a studio, making demos for him and apparently they were in the wrong key for him, so that's as far as that got. So I put my best foot forward and it never happened. Rod's a funny guy. He's more about show business, nowadays.

Unless you've been living under a rock for the past week, you've probably heard about Flashback, a piece of malware targeting users of Apple's Mac OS X that's now estimated to be quietly running on more than 600,000 machines around the world.

That number, which came from Russian antivirus company Dr. Web earlier this week, was confirmed today by security firm Kaspersky. More than 98 percent of the affected computers were running Mac OS X, the firm said.

That's certainly a big number, but how does it stack up to past threats?

""It's the biggest, by far,"" Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at antivirus and computer security firm F-Secure, told CNET in an e-mail. ""I'm afraid the malware-free times of Mac users are behind us permanently.""

Separately, Catalin Cosoi, chief security researcher for antivirus-software maker Bitdefender, said the infection was likely the largest for the Mac so far this decade, but that there's no precise way to measure how many Mac OS computers have been compromised.

""600,000 represents around 12 percent of the Mac OS computers sold in Q4 2011,"" Cosoi said, ""which means that if we count the number of Mac OS devices sold in the past three years, we can estimate that less than 1 percent of the Mac OS computers are possibly infected. On the other hand, if we look at the actual numbers and not at the percentages, the numbers look pretty scary.""

Why now?

The consensus among security researchers is that a threat this size has been long overdue for the Mac, in no small part because of the platform's growing popularity.

Apple has outpaced the growth of the PC industry for 23 straight quarters, according to data from IDC. While the company's iOS devices, like the iPhone and iPad, have not surprisingly seen much faster growth and overall sales in recent years, Apple also broke a Mac sales record in its last quarter, selling more than 5 million computers -- all of which were, of course, running the company's proprietary operating system.

That kind of growth, which as of February put Apple's installed base of Mac OS X users at 63 million, has not gone unnoticed by attackers, according to security researchers.

""As more people buy and use Macs, we'll see more malware,"" Charlie Miller, a principal research consultant for Accuvant Labs, told CNET by telephone. ""Part of it too is that it's a Java vulnerability, and the actual exploit is OS independent, so (malware writers) didn't have to know how to write an OS X exploit.""

In this particular instance, the weak point that malware writers were targeting was Java, a technology Apple hasn't included out of the box on its computers since 2010, but that it supports with its own releases. The runtime is used from anything from enterprise applications to popular 3D games like Minecraft. In November 2010, when announcing plans for the OpenJDK project, Apple said it would continue to maintain these versions through Lion, but that Java SE 7 and beyond would be handled and distributed by Oracle.

Java or no, Paul Ferguson, a senior threat researcher at Trend Micro, suggested that HTML5 -- a Web standard in progress that Apple, Microsoft, and other browser makers are helping to build -- holds the same type of threat for future attacks.

""Wait until HTML5 becomes more ubiquitous for similar types of threat vulnerabilities, and you can have a botnet that runs in your browser,"" Ferguson cautioned. ""The more ubiquitous these platforms are, it won't matter if it's a mobile device or a computer. It it's running Java or any other cross-platform technology, the threat is there.""

Not the first mainstream threat to the Mac

Malware programs are designed to harvest user information that can be sold to third parties, or used for fraudulent activities. Infected machines can also be used as botnets, which can be rented for use in distributed denial of service attacks. Flashback is the latest in a series of attacks against Mac users through malware -- though it turns out not to be so new.

""Flashback's come back around a few times now,"" said Steve Bono, principal security analyst for Independent Security Evaluators. ""It's possible that these computers have been infected since the beginning -- sometime last fall. These things go unpatched, and once a vulnerability is known, it can take months to make the patch.""

That's exactly what happened with Flashback. While earlier versions that relied on a piece of software meant to look like Adobe's Flash installer were squashed as part of security updates, this latest variant went through Java instead. Oracle updated Java to patch the vulnerability the attackers were going through in February, though Apple took longer to patch the version it maintains and delivers to users through its software update tool.

Intego

Prior to Flashback, the malware of interest was a piece of software called MacDefender, which also went by the name of Mac Security and Mac Protector. The fake antivirus program preyed on users by pretending to be a legitimate antivirus program that would find things on a computer then get rid of them in return for users acquiring a full license to the software. As it turned out, the viruses it was pretending to find were actually coming from MacDefender itself.

""The fake antivirus epidemic from last year was the real turning point,"" Roel Schouwenberg, a senior researcher at Kaspersky Labs, told CNET. ""With all the media attention, malware authors realized they could make money off Macs.""

Schouwenberg noted that besides the initial wave from Flashback, and the Mac Defender infections, there was an attack from malware that actually changed your Mac's DNS settings.

Apple's response to the MacDefender issue was to first issue a way for users to identify the malware when coming across it on the Web, then to release a series of updates to its own built-in malware scanner in OS X called XProtect, all in order to protect users from accidentally installing it. Those tools were also able to remove it from machines on which it had already been installed.

Patching the future

One aspect of Apple's internal culture that frustrates security experts is that the company's stance on fixing vulnerabilities has been inconsistent. Experts note that while Apple's mobile iOS platform has been patched in a timely manner, and there are even some at the company who ""beat the security drum"" (according to Schoewenberg), Flashback is an example of the process not working.

""Flashback was patched by Adobe for all major platforms back in February, but Apple only patched it this week,"" Schoewenberg said. ""Waiting two months is not acceptable, and we see OS X threats evolving.""

Apple

Apple, which declined to comment on the Flashback malware, announced plans to tighten up security in the next major version of Mac OS X, due for release this summer, with a feature called Gatekeeper. The new protection tool offers to keep users safe by requiring that developers register with Apple to have their applications signed and verified by Apple. Users can then choose whether they want to keep their computers from installing software that hasn't been signed by a registered developer.

""The approach they're taking is two-pronged: Gatekeeper to make you download stuff that has at least some checking for malicious code, and antivirus [XProtect] baked into the OS for when you happen to get hit,"" Miller said. ""On the grand scheme, they have the right ideas, they just haven't been keeping up on things like they should.""",html

http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-10294587-12.html,LongBox aims to be iTunes for comic books,"July,Pm,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"If you've ever wondered why comic books don't have a digital distribution and management platform the way music, movies, or books do, you're not alone. The good news is that one software company and one man--perhaps clad in an identity-concealing spandex costume--are here to save the day with LongBox.

(Credit: LongBox)

In production for more than three years by QuickSilver Software, LongBox is a free, cross-platform iTunes-style jukebox for comic books. Judging by the proposed feature set, it's the most apt comparison, and one that LongBox CEO and founder Rantz Hoseley is happy to make. ""One of our guiding principles is not replacing print or subsuming print, but creating a business model that works hand in hand with print. We want a diverse clientele.""

In the comic book business, that's no laughing matter. The industry long ago abandoned the spinner racks in your local convenience store as direct market retail stores became more profitable. Direct subscription sales have also dwindled. It's hard to image the modern comic book, from mainstream superheroes like Batman to hipster icons like Scott Pilgrim and film inspirations like ""30 Days of Night,"" without the comic book shop.

Built on a set of proprietary APIs, LongBox will allow readers to purchase and download new comic books in a new, proprietary LBX format. The program contains a viewer that allows you to see pages one at a time or as a double-page spread, zoom in on individual panels, flip through pages, and skin the interface. It even contains an ""anti-spoiler"" feature so you won't see what's coming in a story unless you want to. Since the LBX files are made directly from the InDesign and Quark production files that the publishers send to their printers, the zoom feature won't result in pixelation.

Readers will be able to bookmark pages, and LongBox will support right-to-left reading for manga as well as Western-style left-to-right. It will also support what Hoseley called the ""gray market"" of CBZ and CBR file formats that have been created without the consent of the publishers. However, he cautions, ""CBR and CBZ won't have the same metadata as your store-bought LBX files.""

(Credit: LongBox)

In addition to broad metadata, Hoseley promised that there would be eventual social-networking features baked into the platform, but that there were hurdles unique to comics. ""There are certain things we need to do right,"" he said. ""There's the whole fair-use law of images. We want to make sure that the recommendation system has validity to it, and we want to minimize spamming and grade-inflation.""

Not only will LongBox allow users to read and manage their comics from their desktops and mobile devices, it will also come with access to an online store so readers can purchase their books directly. Starting at 99 cents per issue, the LongBox store will have one major factor that differentiates it from the iTunes model, Hoseley says. ""Along with buying an incentivized 12-issue subscription for $10, publishers can and will provide discount coupons for print versions if (the reader) subscribes to the LongBox version.""

Hoseley was reluctant to go into further detail on how the coupons will work, although he did say that readers should be able to use them at comic book retail shops as well as online stores. If LongBox does wind up driving readers to purchase both digital and print copies, it would be the first time digital content has been used to directly support a physical copy.

In another similarity with iTunes, LongBox will support three methods for getting free comics out to readers. There will be a monthly sampler pack of eight comics, as well as promotional titles that a publisher pays for out-of-pocket. The platform is designed to support ad content as well, and Hoseley said it's possible certain titles will be made free to readers in exchange for watching an advertisement.

LongBox will launch in the fall, probably October, for Windows and Mac, and has plans to support handheld devices, smartphones, and game consoles by the summer of 2010. Users will be able to access their LongBox content on up to three systems. ""You can have your core library, section it off, or burn it to externals,"" Hoseley sayd. ""We will be keeping track of a user's entire library."" Hoseley assured me that there would be privacy safeguards, but didn't specify how or what they would be.

At the San Diego Comic Con Thursday, Hoseley announced that several big-name comic book publishers had already signed on for the platform's launch. Image Comics, Top Cow, Boom Studios, Dabel Brothers, Archaia, Shadowline, and NBM have signed on. Several creator-owned titles have, too, and from multiple genres, including Mouse Guard, Phonogram, Suburban Glamour, Viking, and Hunter-Killer.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-20039881-83.html,Google confirms it pulled malicious Android apps,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"After several days of silence on the issue, Google has confirmed that it removed several malicious apps from its Android Market earlier this week and said that it would remove the apps from users' devices as well.

Only devices running an Android version earlier than version 2.2.2 were susceptible to the rogue apps, which took advantage of known vulnerabilities, the Internet giant reported late last night in the Google Mobile blog. The company believes the only information accessed by the apps were the unique codes used to identify the the specific device and the version of Android that it was running.

Fifty-eight malicious apps were identified and removed Tuesday but not before they were downloaded to about 260,000 devices. Google said it would use a kill switch to remotely remove the apps from users' devices and push an Android security update to affected users to repair the damage done by the apps. Affected users can expect to receive an e-mail from Android Market support explaining the action, Google said.

The developer accounts associated with the apps were suspended and law enforcement officials were contacted, Google said.

Earlier this week, a Reddit user discovered that pirated versions of legitimate apps on the Android Market were infected by a Trojan called DroidDream, which uses a root exploit dubbed ""rageagainstthecage"" to compromise a device, according to a report on enthusiast site Android Police.

The malware was described as especially virulent because it apparently not only can capture user and product information from a device but also has the ability to download more code capable of further damage.

Google representatives did not immediately respond to a request for further information or comment.",html

For a full rundown of new features, check out Seth Rosenblatt's hands on post here, but there's plenty of Windows 7 content to pore over.

Judging from many of the comments, people who have used Windows 7 are saying it's the OS everyone hoped Vista would be. So when I read this week that you can easily setup and run Windows 7 in a virtual environment on an Intel Mac, I had to try it out. I can't advise every Intel Mac user to try this, but if you're an experienced computer user and take care to make sure your current data is backed up beforehand, this method for getting the Windows 7 Release Candidate on your Mac is pretty simple. The best part about it? It's free.

To get started, download VirtualBox (Mac or Windows). This free virtual environment from Sun lets you set up a sterile environment to test out questionable apps, experiment with beta programs, and--for our purposes--launch an entirely different operating system. Anyone with VMWare Fusion or Parallels can skip this step; VirtualBox is for people who don't already have a virtual environment. Boot Camp users who install Windows 7 on a partition can launch Windows 7 after a restart, but VirtualBox makes it possible without a restart for free.

(Credit: CNET)

Once VirtualBox is installed, download the Windows 7 Release Candidate. This is a 2.36GB file--so if you're not on a fast connection (and even if you are) you'll probably want to download it over night. You will need a Hotmail account, MSN account, or Windows Live ID to download the file from Microsoft.

Launch VirtualBox and create a New Virtual Machine. Name the machine ""Windows 7"" or whatever will be recognizable to you. Make sure to set the RAM to 1GB for smoother performance. The rest of the settings you can leave as default. Start your new virtual machine, and choose to install Windows from CD/DVD (you're using a CD image of the software which you'll choose by browsing your desktop). In the Media Source section of that same window, choose the Windows 7 image file you downloaded.

(Credit: CNET)

Next, you will go through several installation dialog boxes which should be mostly self explanatory (Install Now, language choice, etc). When the installer asks which type of installation you want, choose Custom (Advanced) because you are installing cleanly on an untouched virtual system. When the next window asks where you would like to install Windows, install it in the default location (which will be your 20GB virtual hard drive).

From there, wait through the installation process, choose whatever username you want, and Use Recommended settings to start off. Since this is a free release candidate for testing, you can bypass the registration screen completely by hitting Next.

Last, but not least, set the Windows clock to the correct time, choose the type of network your on (if you have a network) and that's it! Windows 7 should start up. The Windows 7 Release Candidate will continue to run through June 2010, when it will begin to nag you to buy the full version.

(Credit: CNET)

Note: If you plan to run Windows regularly in VirtualBox, you will need to take precautions against viruses, spyware, and other common Windows security concerns. At the very least download a free antivirus program and an antispyware program. To get you started for free, I suggest AntiVir and Malwarebytes, though there are plenty of free options available.",html

In fact, Opera 11 beta 1 for Linux is available for download here.

Opera may be getting most of its attention these days from its mobile browsers, but that doesn't mean that the company is ignoring its desktop browser. The first beta for Opera 11 introduces a long-missing extensions API in a lightweight profile similar to those that run on WebKit-powered browsers like Chrome and Safari.

Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, Opera 11 beta 1 debuts other minor but useful changes. The most noticeable of these is tab stacks, a tab grouping mechanism similar in concept to Firefox's Panorama but completely based in the tab bar. To use it, drag one tab on top of another. The bottom tab will disappear and an arrow will appear to the right of the tab. Click it and the tabs in the stack will slide out to one side. To break up a stack, drag a tab off the stack. Mouse over the stack to see previews for all the tabs in the stack.

Another tweak made to tabs is that when you pin a tab, it will automatically jump to the left side of the tab bar. The personal bar has been replaced by a bookmarks bar, both pulling the browser into parity with the competition and making bookmarks accessible with one click.

Plug-ins such as Adobe Flash can now be set to load on-demand, via a check box under the Content section in Preferences. This will allows pages to load content faster and minimize somewhat third-party-plug-in-based exploits, and was impressively smooth in its implementation.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Opera claims the tweak can improve performance up to 30 percent, and that the browser's performance in general has been improved. Opera says that Opera 11 beta 1 is 15 percent to 20 percent faster than Opera 10.63 on Linux, and that the browser size on disk has been reduced by almost one-third.

Opera's security badge system marking sites as verified safe has received an overhaul, too. Click on the gray ""Web"" globe icon to the left of the URL bar to check a site's status. Getting information returned was quick with some sites and slow to stalled with others in the beta. Other color-coded badges include yellow for ""secure"" and green for ""trusted."" Opera's take on the feature is interesting because it provides quick links for reporting a site as fraud or malware. When browsing with Opera Turbo on, the badge will display estimated data savings.

Finally, the mouse gestures tutorial has been given a visual refresh, making it easier to learn them.

Opera's extensions gallery has 131 extensions at the time of writing, which sounds tiny except for the fact that extension support has been available only in a limited alpha release for the past month and appears to be mostly sourced from Opera's internal development team. Now that the feature is ready for a wider release with the beta, expect the number of user-contributed add-ons to jump.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Much like the WebKit-based add-on network, Opera's extensions install as buttons to the right of the search bar and auto-update. Though they might seem to some users to be in conflict with the browser's existing widget network, Opera spokesman Thomas Ford says that's not the case. ""Widgets are stand-alone Web-based applications. They are meant to showcase the browser as an application platform. To that end, widgets work across PCs, phones, TVs, and other environments. Extensions are really there to let you tweak and customize your browser experience.""",html
http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/what-to-look-for-in-a-password-manager,What to look for in a password manager,"June,Pm,Joshua Rotter",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Why use a password manager? Because it's one of the best apps you can invest in, saving you time and protecting all the accounts you need a password for. A good password manager generates and stores passwords and makes it easy to change them. Many managers offer other features, like filling in your information in online forms. However, not every password manager is worth its weight in code. To be truly useful, a password manager must provide good password generation, industry-standard AES-256 encryption (and ideally two-factor authentication), autofill options, and cross-platform compatibility.

Password generation

Most password managers create passwords, knowing that most of us aren't coming up with excellent ones on our own. We tend to choose passwords we can readily recall, such as pet names, birthdays, cities we're from -- information that's easily discovered online, especially on social media. (For tips on making stronger passwords, see Passwords 101.) Moreover, we reuse our passwords, so a hacker who figures out one password can unlock multiple accounts.

A good password manager runs a diagnostic of your current passwords and switches them to more complex passwords, a unique one for each account. Dashlane, LastPass, and 1Password do this well. You needn't worry about remembering all of them, only your single master password.

If one of the sites where you have an account is ever compromised, a good password manager alerts you and offers to generate a new password, just in case hackers have acquired your current one. Dashlane, LastPass, 1Password, and McAfee LiveSafe all provide this service.

Encryption

A password manager should encrypt your log-in emails and passwords. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the specification established by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology -- it's the encryption used for classified documents, but the standard is used worldwide. The strongest level of AES is 256-bit, so look for that when checking a password manager's features. Dashlane, Blur, LastPass, Sticky Password, SafeInCloud, LoginBox Pro, My Passwords, and Password Safe Pro all offer this military-grade encryption.

You should investigate how the password manager handles encryption. Ideally, your data should be encrypted and decrypted locally on your device, so that this info isn't stored elsewhere. Dashlane, LastPass, RoboForm, Sticky Password, Keeper, 1Password, mSecure Password Manager, and OneSafe all offer this.

Many password managers are adding two-factor authentication, which requires an additional step to log in. For example, after you enter your password, you're asked for a code that the app has texted to you. Dashlane, LastPass, RoboForm, Keeper, mSecure Password Manager, OneSafe, McAfee LiveSafe, SafeInCloud, Norton Identity Safe, and LoginBox Pro all offer this added layer of protection.

Autofill

After you enter your master password (and perhaps a second authentication factor), your password manager shouldn't require any other input. You should be able to access your accounts simply by clicking to launch them.

Some password managers go a step further, storing your basic personal information -- name, address, phone number, birth date -- in an encrypted file. With this feature, you can autofill online forms with just one click. Online shoppers should feel confident storing their credit card and shipping info to expedite the ordering process. All major apps offer this feature, except for Android password managers.

Cross-platform access

Most of us rely on multiple devices -- home and work computers, phones, tablets -- and expect to work fluidly across them. A good password manager is cross-platform, putting your sensitive log-ins and other data at your fingertips no matter where you're logging in from. All the major apps we tested offer this except for OneSafe, which doesn't include Windows, and Norton Security, which has a separate app for iOS. Dashlane, Blur, LastPass, Sticky Password Premium, RoboForm, and mSecure have a four-for-one premium price. Keeper, 1Password, and OneSafe let you choose to pay for one device, a bundle of two, or all of them.

A good password manager also includes plug-ins for the major Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Internet Explorer). With those, you can access your password manager from any computer without having to download another app. Of all the password managers we tested, only mSecure doesn't offer this capability.

Here's what I wanted to see: computers pre-packaged with with Microsoft's free antivirus software, Microsoft Security Essentials (download), which I've found to be robust enough for all users except the most cavalier sloppy clickers out there. MSE is also lightweight enough that it doesn't slow your computer and is largely invisible when doing updates. And it's free. Did I already say that?

It's not that free software is better by nature. The full-feature, paid security suites are robust computer and information protectors, especially for people who might otherwise get themselves into trouble online due to a lack of education on basic computing security practices. There's nothing wrong with saving these folks from trouble. But are you one of them?

McAfee-type flubs are also rare, and nothing's magically protecting Microsoft, AVG, Avast, and any other free antivirus apps from the same fate. But I say, given the problems that you might have with any antivirus app, why pay money for features you don't need? It's not like your money buys you complete peace of mind.

So where can you buy a computer with MSE pre-installed? Microsoft confirms that no top-tier computer maker is yet offering it pre-installed on new PCs. That's a shame. In Microsoft's own retail stores, though, MSE is part of the included software suite.

The standard offering now is a trial (time-limited) version of either Symantec's Norton security suite or McAfee's, for no charge, or the option to select either Norton or McAfee. On some product lines you can opt out of the pre-installation of either of these products and get a computer completely unprotected if you ask. Others will let you opt out of the setup of a pre-loaded security suite when you first power up your computer. On these machines, you can easily download MSE and install it yourself.

Keep in mind that connecting an unprotected computer to the Internet is not the smartest thing in the world to do. While I do not believe the hype that a new, unprotected computer will be instantly taken over and turned into a zombie for the Russian mafia, if it connects to the Net over Ethernet or Wi-Fi without running security software, you still don't want to do much, if any, surfing without a protection app installed. (One way to stay belt-and-suspenders safe: download the installer for MSE from a protected computer, put it on a flash drive, and then install it on your new computer before you let it connect to the Net.)

So why can't you get the excellent Microsoft app pre-installed instead of Norton or McAfee? Because the companies that make the paid apps pay the manufacturers for converting trial users to subscribers. Microsoft Security Essentials is free, and Microsoft pays computer makers nothing for installing it. So it's in the manufacturers' financial interests to keep offering you security suites that are too big, too expensive, and frankly too flaky.

A Dell rep even told me that the suite you're more likely to be offered depends on the ""deal of the month"" that Dell has with the security vendors (Symantec or McAfee). It's like walking into a Best Buy, she said: some days the big in-store displays push one product; some days another. It depends on the deal.

Sure, this is capitalism at work, and we can't really fault that. But in this case I call foul. Users' computer security is more important than making a few bucks from them, and not all security suites are created equal, certainly not equal enough to be swapped out based on the deal of the moment. It's time for computer vendors to do the right thing for users, and that means offering good free security apps if they're better for users. And for many users, they are.",html

It's a question which, according to San Diego-based telephone company TelCentris, can be answered by VoxOx.

VoxOx, currently for Windows and Intel-based Macs with plans for Linux and PowerPC Mac versions to be released within six months, incorporates features that have not yet been seen all rolled into one package. It's got multi-protocol chat abilities, bolstered by messaging support on the most popular social-networking sites and support for short Web mail reading and writing. It offers a telephony service that includes call encryption; mobile-to-mobile calls initiated by either SMS or via a Web site; a free personal-assistant-style call-forwarding service; and a system for earning minutes by watching ads or responding to surveys.

(Credit: CNET Networks)

Entering public beta Monday, VoxOx is able to do all this because the software is being developed by a telephone company, says TelCentris' CFO Michael Faught. ""Part of allowing users to take control of their interconnected lifestyle is to allow them to click a button and fire out an e-mail.""

One of VoxOx's aims, he said, is to make it as simple as sending an e-mail to initiate any kind of communication. When people are forced to use so many different programs to complete similar tasks, ""it has become unmanageable.""

Part of that simplification process includes making VoxOx's API open source, said TelCentris' CEO Bryan Hertz. They hope to create a similar open-source community that can build out features for VoxOx that they might not have the time for or even consider. This is a playbook page that Skype also uses to great effect: Skype has several hundred ""extras"" that most likely have not hurt user interest.

TelCentris' interest in expanding what it can do also comes from its current customer base. Hertz notes that the company provides services to more than a dozen phone companies, and provides hosted phone services to dozens of small to medium businesses globally, with customers ranging from the Philippines to Brazil.

In addition to the features listed above, VoxOx offers 120 free minutes of call time to all registrants at the U.S. rate; a free U.S.-based phone number; international calling; pay-by-minute upgrade plans; voicemail; customizable hold music; video conferencing with VoxOx contacts; two-way text messaging; and tabbed instant messaging for MSN, ICQ, AOL, Jabber, Yahoo, and Google.

To ramp up interest, VoxOx offers all users an additional 120 free calling minutes to every person they recommend who signs up. Users can also watch short advertisements or fill out surveys to earn additional minutes. They've got a sweet deal going for CNET readers, too:

(Credit: CNET Networks)

""The first 500 users to sign up for VoxOx through CNET will receive 1,200 minutes of free calling to U.S. and Canada phone numbers. The 1,200 minutes equal 1,200 'Vox Points.' These Vox Points are also redeemable for international calls at varied rates. Vox Points do not expire, and in coming months, Vox Points will also be redeemable for free gadgets, such as a Bluetooth headset and ATA box.""

Click here to take advantage of this offer.

Users can currently share files up to 100MB via a generated download link that they can then share via e-mail or instant message. Mobile access is available from a mobile browser, iPhone, and WAP, with a planned native iPhone app.

Other planned features for the near future include an ATA upgrade for physical home phones, a personal assistant, fax support, the ability to route inbound text to VoxOx or your cell phone, video conferencing with non-VoxOx contacts, untabbed IM, group chat IM, Away message defaults to Social Status, Facebook IM support, and additional IM protocols. VoxOx hopes to incorporate support for LinkedIn, MySpace, Twitter, and YouTube on the social-networking side, and Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook, and Mac contact importing.

When you install VoxOx, it's hard not to note that the main Home interface looks like an iPhone. That was intentional, Hertz says. ""The interface is skinnable, but the default looks like that for continuity with smartphones,"" Hertz said.

From there, square icons with rounded corners and highlighted by bright colors take you to 15 program features: contacts, a keypad for on-the-fly dialing, your calling and chat history, account settings, a setup Wizard, Call-Back, Reach-Me, Vmail/Fax, Hold Music, Vox Points, Updates, Invites, Web Portal, Mobile, and the Help button, which jumps to the Web forums, the FAQ, user guides, and videos. Paying users get voice and e-mail support, too.

(Credit: CNET Networks)

The Call-Back feature is what sets VoxOx apart from other VoIP services. Call-Back has two tabs in it, one for Web-initiated callback and one for starting the callback with an SMS. Under the Web callback, you set the country, country code, and area code and phone number for the number that you want to be reached at, and then enter in the settings for the person you're trying to call.

Hit Initiate Callback at the bottom of the pane. VoxOx will call you from a local number. Pick up and you'll hear ringing through the earpiece as if you've dialed a number. That's VoxOx calling the person at the second number you entered from a number that's local to them. When they pick up, you'll be able to talk as if you've made a long-distance call but without the long-distance charges. The process is simpler than it sounds, and in three tests the call quality for both me and the person I was speaking to was fine. There were no instances of tinniness or echoing.

Initiating the SMS Callback is, in some respects, even easier. Once you set your cell phone number in the interface, you send a text message from your phone to the number 1-323-649-9139. In the body of the message, you must type in 011 followed by the country code, the area code, and the phone number without any hyphens.

Shortly after, you should receive a phone call from the permanent VoxOx number that you've been assigned at the top of the main VoxOx interface. Answer it, wait a few seconds, and you'll hear ringing. If you're lucky, the person you're trying to reach won't be freaked out by the unfamiliar local number that's calling them and they'll pick up. I tested this with friends in Sweden and Australia, and again encountered no tinniness, no echo, and no delays.

Unfortunately, I did encounter one angry wife who did not think highly of me waking her up in the middle of the night. My attempts to blame misremembering the time change from Boston to Melbourne on VoxOx were strangely met with extreme derision.

A Home button at the top of the pane makes it easy to jump back to the main interface. The next feature, Reach-Me, lets users configure multiple call-forwarding numbers, as well as set the number of seconds one of them can ring before jumping to the next number. You can also set the number of seconds the dialed number will ring before Reach-Me kicks in, and whether your multiple call-forwarding numbers will be attempted simultaneously or in order.

(Credit: CNET Networks)

Given how much it can do, I expected VoxOx to be a massive piece of bloatware. Surprisingly, the installation process took around one minute, and at launch it was using around 90MB of RAM. This jumped up to around 380MB while running eight simultaneous chats and a telephony session--a bit high, but not outrageously so. The computer I tested it on had 2GB of RAM, and was running a fully loaded Firefox, an RSS client, and a jukebox, so I wasn't expecting great performance. However, VoxOx smoothly jumped from pane to pane and there was no sluggishness in its response time.

As you can tell from the list of planned features above, VoxOx is still very much in beta. Many of the features that will make it stand above its competitors haven't been fully rolled out yet, so it's a little hard to judge on its merits as it is. Because it encourages such heavy cross-pollination between cell phones and computers, it'd be great if there was a way to import cell phone contacts. You also cannot, as of yet, begin an SMS Call-Back and have it forwarded via Reach-Me to a different phone.

Even with those drawbacks, VoxOx looks to force changes in the telephony and instant-messaging market that favor users more than they do now--as long as we can all remember what time zone we're calling.",html

Over the past two weeks iPhone and iPad users alike have been waiting for the promised iOS 4.2 update. After a false alarm last Friday, Apple pushed out Gold Master developer versions of the update today and Wednesday. So as we wait for the real deal--which could come as early as tomorrow --we downloaded the Gold Master to give the update a trial run.

Apple won't release an official list of new features until iOS 4.2 becomes available to the general public, but we scanned through the additions that have been observed so far. Nothing will blow your mind, but we're never one to pass over new features, no matter how small they are. The iPhone 4 gets a few interface tweaks, more customization for message alerts, printing for photos and Safari pages, additional parental controls, and an option for jumping directly to a FaceTime call from a messaging thread. You also get the ability to search for text on a Safari page, which is most welcome. iOS 4.1, which came out in September, added high-dynamic range photos, support for TV show rentals on iTunes and brought back the Field test mode.

iOS 4.2 for iPad has plenty of features to offer as well. Not only does it bring Apple's tablet device up to speed with the latest iPhone OS features like Multitasking, App folders, and GameCenter, but iPad users will also get some interesting additions of their own. Under iOS 4.2, the iPad now lets you search for local printers, search for instances of a word on Web pages, adjust brightness from the multitask screen, and much more.

We'll continue to add new features as we find them. And once the update goes live, we'll follow up with more analysis. In the meantime, keep clicking that ""check for update"" button in iTunes.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-20068838-37/first-take-mac-os-x-lion-coming-in-july-for-$29.99/,First Take: Mac OS X Lion coming in July for $29.99,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"CNET

Amid the fanfare of Steve Jobs' return to the stage for the WWDC 2011 conference, Apple went into plenty of detail on how the latest big-cat OS will integrate with iOS devices, mimic iOS features, work with iCloud, and much more.

Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, set for release next month and priced at $29.99, introduces a big shift toward centralizing all your content, whether it's on your desktop, your iOS device, or in the newly launched iCloud.

Many of the features in Mac OS X Lion have been made public in the past and all point toward an integration of data across multiple platforms.

Apple executive Philip Schiller started off talking about how multitouch gestures are the standard interface for iPhones, iPod Touches, and iPads, and some gestures can already be used on Mac laptops and Apple's Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad. But with Lion, Apple says it's adding even more gestures and fine-tuning existing swipes and pinches with a much smoother, more realistic feel.

Next came full-screen apps. For a long time now, many Mac users have complained about Mac apps not having the ability to go full screen (Windows switchers are particularly aware of this). Thankfully, with OS X Lion, Mac users will now have the ability to view any app full screen, so they can get to work without all the usual distractions. To switch to a different app or return to the desktop, users can simply swipe the trackpad. Craig Federighi came on stage to show how full screen apps and multitouch gestures work together.

Mission Control is another long-awaited OS X feature that will become available with OS X Lion. With a swipe on the trackpad, users will be able to see, at a glance, everything that's running on their Mac, from apps to their associated open windows along with what's running in Spaces. With a centralized location to see everything running on their Mac, users will be able to get where they want to go immediately, without having to dig through menus, switch between Expose views, or long-click Dock icons.

The recently released Mac App Store, Apple seems to be continuing on the path of what the company views as a safer environment for distributing apps. While some look at the Mac App Store and see a closed garden like the iTunes App Store, the setup does ensure that apps will work seamlessly on Apple's devices. Schiller went into detail of how developers will be able to take advantage of several new features to make development easier.

LaunchPad is another new feature coming in Mac OS X Lion, letting Mac desktop and laptop users quickly launch apps just like they would using an iOS device. Along with the quick access afforded by the grid-like app layout, users will be able to create folders for better organization, and when they buy apps at the Mac App Store, those apps will automatically show up on LaunchPad. Federighi came back on stage to show how buying an app at the Mac App Store automatically makes it show up on LaunchPad. He also demonstrated how you can drag newly purchased apps wherever you want in LaunchPad.

Next, Schiller showed how file management will be easier in Mac OS X Lion owing to a few new features that help users save their work, track previous changes, and pick up where they left off after a shutdown. With Versions and new auto-saving features, Lion automatically creates a version each time users open it and every hour they work on it. Just like the interface in Time Machine, users will be able to cycle back through versions if they just want to retrieve a previously deleted item, for example. They can then cut and paste work from an earlier version of their document to the current version.

Mac OS X Lion's new Resume feature lets users get back to where they left off after a shutdown or restart, bringing them back to exactly where they were when they closed out. This means they won't need to reopen all their apps and set everything up after a restart--all will be ready right from where they left off. In the demo, Federighi showed off how quitting an app doesn't prompt you with a save dialog because Lion has not only auto-saved your work, but also will save all your settings and how each window was laid out in the app.

Next up was AirDrop. Schiller showed how using AirDrop will let you drag and drop documents to nearby users. Simply open the peer-to-peer Wi-Fi based network, drag the document to your chosen user, and the AirDrop automatically saves it to that users Downloads folder.

Apple's Mail program will receive a face-lift as well, using much the same layout found on the iPad's Mail app. Now with Mail 5, users will be able to quickly browse through messages on the left and get a full-screen preview of every e-mail on the right. The addition of a new Mailbox bar will let users quickly access the most-used mail folders, letting them get where they want to go quickly. Schiller demonstrated the improved searching in Mail 5, showing how the app automatically gives you contacts and content from actual e-mails through the drop-down so you can find what you want quickly.

Mail 5 also offers a new conversation view, much like an organization system found in the latest versions of Microsoft Outlook. With Conversation view, users will be able to group an entire thread of e-mails by conversation so they can quickly get to everything said about a subject. From there they can either save or delete entire conversations with only a couple of clicks. You can also drag-and-drop entire conversations to your favorites bar in Mail.

Schiller pointed out that they were only demonstrating the main features, but there was plenty more to look at.

As expected, Lion will only be available in the Mac App Store and will be 4GB in size. It installs right in place, and when you purchase it, you can use it on all your authorized Macs. Mac OS X Lion will retail for $29.99.",html

There are probably hundreds of apps and sites that will help you find good places to eat and cool places to hang out. And then there's that gorilla, Yelp. But even in this crowded space, the new Loku has a secret sauce that works. It's too bad the best part of the site is not obvious, and that there's not yet a smartphone app from this company. But this is still a good site to get to know.

Loku finds news and recommends places in neighborhoods based on its algorithms that apply natural language processing and sentiment analysis to the reviews, posts, and social media updates it reads.

For example, when looking for information related to a neighborhood like The Mission in San Francisco, which is young and more artsy than, say, Nob Hill, it will give weight to stories that have language that resonates with the neighborhood vibe. ""Rad"" in a user review of a restaurant will help Loku place it as place good for people visiting the neighborhood to consider, CEO Dan Street says. But if you're looking at the swanky Nob Hill, the site will give more weight to stories that talk about how elegant a place is.

You can see the algorithms working hard under Loku's ""Know Local"" tab, where the it does a good job of creating neighborhood portals containing news, local deals, and even police reports.

But the real gem of this service is the non-default ""Go Local"" tab, where you can select your mood using sliders on a few nonstandard but intuitive scales like ""Local,"" ""Foodie,"" ""Flirty,"" and ""Swanky."" You also select a neighborhood, and Loku matches your feelings against its sentiment analysis of various food reviews. I found that it does a good job of finding restaurants that mesh with what I was looking for, but more importantly is does a great job of providing a different view on options, with different suggestions, than you'll get anywhere else.

Loku is a strong service for anyone visiting one of the 15 U.S. cities it has data on. Unfortunately it's a Web-only service right now. There's no app, although one is coming. Why didn't the team do the mobile app first? ""It's easier to create a lot of changes on the Web,"" Street told me. He's been working on this app for three years, and has changed directions with it a few times. Recently, he said, the open-source community has solved problems in three of the areas his team was struggling with: natural-language processing, ranking of data, and presentation of it. ""A lot of the work we did ourselves a few years ago is now obsolete. But now that we've locked down the secret sauce and the recipe, we'll make a mobile app.""

The business for Loku is an emerging standard for venue-finding services. It aggregates deals and offers from other sources, including consumer facing services like Groupon and Livingsocial, as well as from white-label deal networks like OfferEx. Street says it makes the business side the Loku equation very straightforward and effective. ""There's no reason to have a sales force,"" he says.

That last bit may be true for now, but when there's no sales force, there's also nobody between your company and declining per-transaction revenues, so I might encourage him to find a model where Loku has more control of its own destiny. But for now, the offers aggregation play does seem to make sense.

The public beta is available for Windows and Mac, and although it's still quite rough in some spots, it represents a major breakthrough for the print-centric medium.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

When you open LongBox v0.5, you'll see a massive information overload. The layout uses boxes to keep the busy display from getting too chaotic, but the varying shades of blue don't keep things as separate as they could be. Just because this is comics doesn't mean you're going to encounter a lot of primary colors or ziptones here, but some of that old-school feel might have helped here.

In the upper left box, you'll see a horizontal scroll of featured titles. Below that is a newsfeed from the comic book news and reviews Web site Comic Book Resources. The Blackbox is a comic creator spotlight, with the debut focus on Steven Niles, perhaps best known as the writer of 30 Days of Night. It is currently not functioning.

The column on the right is devoted to your LongBox stats on top and a scroll list of comic books being published for the current week. The stats counter wasn't working in the version I tested but should display your purchased comics, comics subscriptions, and comics loaded on your current device. That's a hint at what's to come for LongBox, which anticipates an iPad version, an Android tablet version, Xbox support, and support for other handheld devices. Comics downloaded through LongBox are shared to your account in addition to being stored locally, so you'll be able to read them on any LongBox-supported device without having to download them a second time.

Sitting calmly above all the noise is the LongBox navigation bar. Next to the home button is the Library, where comics you've downloaded reside, followed by the Store, the Reader, and the Options button. Nine comics are currently available for free in the store, including both mainstream works like ""Witchblade,"" comics that have been made into movies like ""Wanted,"" and cult favorites like ""Punks.""

The default view shows the comics as free-floating covers with the title and issue number above the image and a mouse-over link to the publisher info below it. Mouse over a comic and two options appear. The ""i"" will open an information box that includes a synopsis, a link to a preview, a wishlist option, and a purchase button. The ""+"" will add the comic to your shopping cart. There's also a list view, which contains a dedicated preview window and a more text-centric approach.

Accessing the store will require registration, a free process. Because the comics are free for the moment, no credit card information needs to be revealed at this time. Through the Options menu, users can choose to log in when LongBox starts, or to enter their information manually. Here you can switch skins and change your start screen from the main window to the reader, store, shopping cart, or last viewed screen when you start LongBox.

The shopping cart lives on the right edge of the top navigation bar, along with your wishlist, featured LongBox specials, and the Help button which opens a PDF. There's a search bar that anchors the two sets of buttons that becomes a recently read list in Reader mode. It appears to work fine from all screens except the default window.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblat/CNET)

The Reader mode opens to a blank screen. You can click on the Reader button again to open up the default system file browser, although the Reader does support drag-and-drop for non-LongBox formatted CBR and CBZ comics. In the Library window, however, you'll see an interface that looks like the LongBox Store but with page navigation controls at the bottom. Mouse over a comic and click the icon that appears to open it.

Comics that you haven't read before will open smoothly, but ones in the middle of being read are more sluggish. More often than not I had to mouse over the navigation buttons to get the comic to appear. Several times I had to click on a nav button, or in the black space where the comic should have been, to get it to appear.

In Reader mode, the shopping cart and help buttons are replaced by supplementary navigation buttons. There's a bookmarks button, known to be not working at the time of writing, and a ""double"" button that opens pages two at a time. This is a well-designed and essential tool for comics, which often use a two-page spread to highlight story moments that call for emphasized action.

There's a Manga button, which can be used for Japanese and Hebrew comics that are published in a right-to-left reading order, and a Zoom button that offers three kinds of viewing. Panel zoom focuses in on the comic at panel width, while page zoom is more of a mid-length zoom, but still bigger than the default viewpoint. Free zoom works like a magnifying glass, large enough so that you can see an entire panel in the frame. The scroll wheel can help you move the page under page zoom, and clicking on the magnifying glass zoom icon will toggle between the most recently selected zoom mode and the default view.

Lastly, there's a currently nonfunctional Audio button. There's a long history of comics and music crossing over, and the CEO of LongBox, Rantz Hoseley, won an Eisner Award for editing an anthology, ""Comic Book Tattoo,"" a collection of comics inspired by Tori Amos' songs. If the button allowed publishers to associate recommended playlists with their comics, this could be a really cool feature, but there's no word as of yet as to what it can do.

The navigation controls at the bottom look smart but still need tweaking. There are controls to move forward or backward by a single page, or flip to the beginning or end of the comic. When you mouse over the controls, a pop-up bar appears previewing the pages of the comic that looks and feels like mini and elongated version of iTunes' Cover View mode. However, the previews are all blank unless you've already viewed a page. This could be a clever way to avoid spoiling the story, or another bug. It's a bit hard to tell at the moment.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

The Reader mode is really the guts of the program, and a comic read on a 19-inch monitor with occasional juicing from the zoom mode was enjoyable. Nobody really cares about the news features or even the store if you can't read the comic, and on that end LongBox succeeds. However, it's likely that users with significantly smaller or older screens will find it unbearable.

Hoseley has stated that the beta will proceed in three stages. The current public beta, version 0.5.2, is nearly identical to the private beta that I began testing toward the end of 2009. The next stage will introduce redemption codes for nonwatermarked comics. The final stage will introduce full e-commerce functionality to the LongBox store, and add about 100 comics to the store.

Besides the ones mentioned above, there are plenty of known bugs in LongBox. Font usage needs to be standardized, the Comic Book Resources feed requires tweaking, the default window doesn't pull titles from LongBox site correctly, and metadata editing needs work.

The LongBox public beta showcases a massive amount of potential, but unlike the latest Web browser beta from whichever browser publisher is your favorite, this is definitely a rough work and is still very much in progress. It faces massive challenges beyond getting the software to work correctly. Unlike music and MP3s, there's currently no single approved file format for comics. CBRs and CBZ are little more than image archive containers.

There's also the issue of adoption. Except for the rise of graphic novels, comics have been dependent on the direct market niche comic book stores. Will readers flock to digital versions of them? And will those readers jump from stores to digital, or will LongBox bring in new readership?

Overall, though, LongBox represents a good-faith effort to shove the medium out of its print-based nest. It's just too soon to tell whether it can fly.",html

While the wait persists for an iPhone 5, a new report says the much-delayed white version of the current-generation iPhone 4 will go on sale by the end of the month.

Citing three sources familiar with Apple's plans, Bloomberg reports that the company intends to put the white version of the popular handset up for sale ""in the next few weeks"" for both AT&T and Verizon Wireless customers.

Bloomberg also said that Apple does not plan to announce a follow-up to the iPhone 4 at the Worldwide Developers Conference slated for early June, adding additional fuel to rumors that Apple is behind on its usual handset release schedule.

Apple promised a white version of the iPhone 4 when it first announced the phone, though the company failed to ship it alongside the black version that's been on sale for the past 10 months. At the time, the company said the alternate color was proving more ""challenging to manufacture than we originally expected.""

According to Bloomberg's sources, the sizable delay had been attributed, in part, to the white model's paint peeling when it got hot. An analyst report published last month said Apple had changed the film material being used to keep the device laminated, putting the company back on track to ship the phone in April.

When introducing the iPad 2 early last month, Apple CEO Steve Jobs made it a point that the iPad 2 would ship in both black and white from day one. The company delivered on that promise. Days later, Phil Schiller, Apple's vice president of worldwide product marketing, posted a note on Twitter saying the white iPhone 4 would be available this spring.

Apple broke its own record in its last fiscal quarter, selling 16.2 million iPhones. The company announces its second fiscal quarter earnings next Wednesday, with some analysts predicting it's sold an even higher number during that time.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Bloomberg report.

Update at 12:37 p.m. PT on 4/14: Apple has told The Wall Street Journal that the white iPhone 4 is still on track to be released ""in the spring,"" though did not go into detail about what carriers the device would be offered on or if that deadline falls within Bloomberg's April timeframe.",html

The Norton CyberCrime Index lies somewhere between a weather report and the United States' threat level advisory system, and Norton 360 version 5 launches with a direct link to it.

The CyberCrime Index uses a statistical model based on information from Symantec's Global Intelligence Network, ID Analytics, and DataLossDB. At the top level, the CyberCrime Index takes this data and creates a number evaluating the relative risk of the threats of the day. However, it also provides a more in-depth look at active threats, threat trends, and provides advice on what kinds of behaviors are being most heavily targeted that day.

Symantec has had the statistical model and algorithm it uses in the CyberCrime Index vouched for by the University of Texas at San Antonio.

The service is set to go live this morning, so check back here later today for a hands-on update.

Symantec isn't forcing the index on any of its users, though the new version of Norton 360 does include a direct link to the service. Version 5 of Norton 360 includes the real-time threat map that debuted in Norton's 2011 consumer suites, along with all the features that were introduced in Norton's 2011 consumer suites last fall. These include updates to Norton's Insight engine, which instantly checks a file's origins and how long it's existed to determine how safe it is. The new version of System Insight also profiles your programs to determine if any of them are slowing down system performance, and automatically alerts users when a program is eating up too many resources.

Now included in Norton 360 is the Norton Bootable Recovery Tool, which will clean heavily infected systems enough to get Norton 360 installed, and can create a rescue tool on disc or USB so that your computer can be resuscitated. The backup features in Norton 360 have been improved, too, adding in automatic file encryption to the backup process. Lastly, Norton Safe Web's social-media scanner has been imported from Norton Internet Security 2011. Currently, it still only supports Facebook, though that's a good start: it will check your Facebook wall and news feeds from within Norton.

Norton 360 version 5 (review) comes with a 30-day trial and can be used on up to three computers. A one-year license with 2GB of online storage retails for $79.99. Bumping that up to 25GB of storage costs $99.99.",html

In its first two years, Chrome development took a more collaborative approach than most Google projects, but now its leaders have decided on more sharply defined leadership roles to better manage the browser's growth.

Instead of notifying a ""watchlist"" of programmers who are affected by a particular change to the code, a programmer on an ""owners"" list must now approve the change, high-ranking Chrome engineer Ben Goodger announced yesterday on the developers' mailing list for the open-source Chromium project that underlies Chrome. Goodger wrote:

Much of Chromium's practices are modeled on Google's own internal engineering practices. OWNERS files were one area where we explicitly diverged. Why? In the past I had been concerned about the social effects of OWNERS files--I had been concerned about territoriality which can sometimes creep in any collaborative project. We had encouraged the development of ""alternative"" means of change notification, and so we have WATCHLISTS. WATCHLISTS proved insufficient for many of us, however. Darin [Fisher, another high-ranking Chrome leader] and I discussed the issue, and talking with other senior engineers decided that OWNERS files seemed like a more comprehensive answer.

The basic problem, he said, is quality control. ""Owners files provide a means for people to find engineers experienced in developing specific areas for code reviews. They are designed to help ensure changes don't fall through the cracks and get appropriate scrutiny,"" he said.

Chrome has open-source foundations, including contributions from programmers outside Google. But as with Linux, Android, MySQL, and many other open-source projects, the approach doesn't mean it's a hobby run by volunteers. The move to the owners system, though, reflects another step toward professional management of the software.

Goodger laid out his case this way:

In the more than two years since the Chromium project started, the number of people contributing has grown immensely. With this expansion has come many challenges, the most important of which is ensuring the continuity of our product and development principles. As our project has grown in size and scope, the code-base has begun to show signs of fatigue... I speak for a number of leads on the team when I say that we've had a hard time keeping up with the pace of change. As we expand the scope of Chrome in many different directions, it's critical that we consider even more carefully the design of the core code. As we do this it is important to rely on the most experienced engineers in each area.

He laid out the full details of the new code governance in a document describing Chromium's new owners system. Among its strictures:",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20016432-56.html,Internet Explorer 9: From corporate memo to beta,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"SAN FRANCISCO--Just days after launching Internet Explorer 8 in March 2009, Microsoft's Dean Hachamovitch wrote a memo about what the company really needed to do with the next version of its browser.

""A browser is only as good as the underlying operating system,"" the head of the IE team said in an e-mail to his staff and others at Microsoft. ""We have amazing opportunities to differentiate IE because of the underlying strengths of Windows. Our broad opportunity is making Windows the best place to experience the web.""

Internet Explorer, he knew, needed to run much faster, be much more standards compliant, and really harness the power of the PC.

Fast forward 18 months and Microsoft now has a public beta of the browser that achieves several of the goals that Hachamovitch laid out in his memo. Internet Explorer 9 has better support for HTML5 and other Web standards, taps the PC graphics chip for hardware acceleration, and includes a much faster JavaScript engine.

On the visual front, the new browser has a minimalist approach. As first reported by CNET last month, the design principle for the new browser is the creation of a theater with individual Web sites as the stars of the show. Indeed, a good chunk of Wednesday's beta launch event will be focused on the work done by the various Web site creators that Microsoft has lined up to support IE9's new features.

Hachamovitch said it is fitting that the 10:30 a.m. PDT launch of the IE9 beta is taking place in the working-class, industrial South of Market section of San Francisco rather than a flashier locale like Union Square. The downscale digs reflect the fact that IE9 tries to do its job without attracting much attention. ""This is not an Armani neighborhood,"" he said Tuesday in an interview at the launch site here.

The launch of a new version of Internet Explorer comes as the browser race has become increasingly competitive and more strategically important. Microsoft's browser, though still the market leader with about 60 percent of the market, has been ceding share for years, first to Mozilla's Firefox and more recently to Google's Chrome OS.

Beyond that, the Web has become the hub of much of people's computing experience and Microsoft is eager to show that the PC matters. By using hardware acceleration, Microsoft is hoping to give people a reason to choose Windows over other current choices and over emerging rivals such as Chrome.

Along with making the beta version available for download later on Wednesday, Microsoft is detailing the user interface and other features of the browser.

As compared with past versions of IE, the new version is far more streamlined, featuring a prominent back and forward button, a single bar for both searching and entering Web addresses, and surprisingly little else. Small icons on the far right let people access settings or their favorite sites, though neither option is given much prominence.

Rather than focus on its own interface, IE9 takes advantage of a number of Windows 7 features, such as allowing users to pin their favorite sites to the taskbar. Web sites opened in this fashion borrow the color scheme and icon from the Web site in question. Web sites can also create customized ""jump lists"" that go to a particular part of the site when a user right clicks on the taskbar icon. Developers can also have the taskbar icon deliver notifications, such as changing icons to indicate and alert or displaying the number of new messages in an in-box.

Hachamovitch said that tapping the operating system's interface makes sense, given that people are far more used to the way Windows works--even Windows 7--than they are to the nuances of the browser. He noted that 87 percent of Windows users launch applications that are pinned to their desktop while less than 5 percent put sites on their favorites bar.

Microsoft is also taking the approach it used to highlight potential malware and phishing attempts to warn that downloads that might be suspicious. The company is adding the notion of reputation to downloads, offering both ratings and details on how frequently downloaded a piece of content is.

The reveal for IE9 has been a slow one. Microsoft first discussed IE9 and talked about hardware acceleration at last fall's professional developers conference. Although the look of IE9 wasn't publicly known until a leak last month, Hachamovitch said the ideas were already in place by that conference, which was just a few weeks into the coding of the new browser.

By this past spring, Microsoft had launched a test drive of the new browser's engine. Though the code still didn't give a sense for how the browser would feel, other characteristics became clear, such as which standards the browser would support and the degree to which Microsoft had truly sped up its JavaScript engine.

With the beta, Microsoft is finally showing the look of the browser and giving the public a chance to really put it through its paces. As for the final version, I'm told it is a safe bet that it won't come this year, but Microsoft hasn't given a specific time frame. There is some speculation that Microsoft's aim is to have it ready for next spring's Mix event in Las Vegas.

To run the beta software, users need Vista or Windows 7 and have to replace their current version of the browser with the IE9 beta.

As is customary for Microsoft launches, the company is putting a good deal of emphasis on the partners it has lined up for the event--a list that includes Twitter, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal. Rock bands Gorillaz and The Killers have customized their Web sites to take advantage of IE9, while Wordpress is adopting IE9's customization options, opening up jump lists and other features to hundreds of top blogs.

Hachamovitch said that the 70 partners who will be present at the launch event collectively reach two-thirds of Internet users.",html

Editors' note: This post was updated August 2, 2011, to reflect that the app is now publicly available.

Skype for iPad got off to a rocky start. It was meant to be available in the App Store in June, languished until August 1, was introduced, pullled for a few hours, and then, finally, settled in. Here's our original hands-on review from June; we'll continue using the app now that the final version is in.

The new iPad-optimized Skype client takes advantage of the tablet's larger screen real estate, making for crisp and clear video chat over Wi-Fi, and often less crisp chat over 3G.

 Skype posts, pulls video of iPad video chat app



The chat interface isn't as polished or snazzy as we've seen for other iPad apps, but it's fairly intuitive. Contacts are on the left with your text messages on the right. In our tests, chat over 3G or Wi-Fi worked predictably smoothly. But the real story with the iPad 2's front-facing camera was how well Skype handled video calls over different connection speeds.

Although Skype for iPad will work on both iPad versions, you'll only be able to broadcast video from the iPad 2, since it has a front-facing camera. You can still receive video on an original iPad. Skype for iPad will work on both Wi-Fi and 3G, but it was quick to point out that video quality might take a hit on slower 3G connections, and we were quick to verify that Skype quality is often subpar over 3G.

During our preliminary tests, we made calls over Wi-Fi to an iPhone 4 (3G) and to Skype on a desktop computer with a hard line. Wi-Fi video calling to the desktop produced the best quality on both ends, with high image resolution and video that was mostly smooth; there was only a slight delay. During a call, our friends notices almost no difference in video quality when we switched between the front- and rear-facing iPad 2 cameras; they told us that both images had sharp edges and nothing looked especially blurred.

We were also able to easily send and receive chat messages while a video call was connected, although the chat window and keyboard obscured almost the entire image, and we had to manually close the keyboard when we were done so we could see the video again, a slight inconvenience.

The story wasn't as optimistic in our limited testing to an iPhone on a 3G network. We got passable video calling at best; at worst, the video (and audio) frequently froze. Fortunately, Skype offers the option to switch to audio-only during a video call so not all is lost if your 3G connection isn't displaying video properly.

As with any VoIP service, the image and audio quality often and ultimately comes down to the strength of the signal or bandwidth connection on both ends, plus the quality of the hardware itself (like a Webcam, for instance). That makes hands-on tests like this one inherently subjective and changeable. However, there's much that VoIP service providers can do to help jump technological hurdles, as Skype itself has touted in the past.

Among the new features, Skype for iPad offers a redesigned contact page that displays recent contacts and recent call history on the left, and thumbnails for your contacts on the right. Skype for iPad also supports Skype Out for those who have purchased credit. You tap a button to bring forth the dial pad.

We'll continue to take a closer look at Skype for iPad, but as with most of Skype's mobile apps, the essential features for communication are all here, although you won't find everything that's available on the more memory-intensive desktop versions.

With the app's ability to call other Skype users on any device or desktop over Wi-Fi, Skype on iPad challenges Apple's FaceTime. Add on Skype's support for 3G connections as well (FaceTime is Wi-Fi-only), and you've got an app that could finally give Apple's FaceTime a run for its money.",html
http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/a-guide-to-microsoft-edge,A guide to Microsoft Edge,"September,Pm,Tom Mcnamara",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"In Windows 10, Microsoft has replaced Internet Explorer 11 with Microsoft Edge, initially known as Project Spartan. (While IE 11 is no longer the default browser, it's still present in the background, because many applications still use parts of it, and it's deeply integrated into many business operations.) Edge is great but missing a couple pieces: it doesn't support Chrome and Firefox extensions yet (it will soon), and it has some limitations when compared to those browsers that you should be aware of. But Edge looks like the future of Microsoft's Web browser strategy, so get a head start on navigating it with our tips.

Edge's touch-friendly UI

While the UI elements in Internet Explorer were optimized for mouse and keyboard input, Edge's address bar and top buttons have been fattened up for touch navigation. These don't push down your webpage -- you still see about as much as before -- because Edge integrates its tabs into the title, where they operate above the address bar instead of next to it. Each tab has a large X to tap or click to close it, and there's a large plus sign to create a new tab. The Refresh button has been moved out of the address bar and put next to the Back and Forward buttons.

Making Web Notes

Click the Make a Web Note button in the upper right-hand corner to swap Edge's UI with buttons that enable pen-like input. When you click-and-drag with your mouse pointer in this mode, it will act like the paintbrush tool in Photoshop and draw a line that follows where you move your mouse pointer (or your fingertip, if you have a touch screen). The buttons in the upper left are fairly intuitive. Click the leftmost one to open your color picker and brush size selector. The button to the right of that switches the brush to a highlighter.

The button to the left of the highlighter button switches to an eraser, but it will remove an entire stroke, rather than wiping away the part of the painted area that you're clicking. The next button in the series lets you add or remove text annotation. The Clip tool at the end of the series saves a selected area of the screen.

Oddly, none of your Web Notes results can be saved as an image file. You can only send them to OneNote or add them to your Favorites.

Using Favorites (bookmarks)

Pressing Ctrl-D in Edge gives you two ways of bookmarking a page. It defaults to creating a favorite, which is more or less a bookmark. The other option is Reading List. This works like Pocket -- this list is organized by thumbnails with captions. It's basically a more visual bookmark for quicker navigation. As with Internet Explorer, you access your bookmarks and reading list by pressing Ctrl-I. But unlike Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, there is no search function here. And favorites and Reading List items are sorted only in reverse chronology (the most recent entries show up first). That will get unwieldy pretty quickly, so Edge would gain a lot from an add-on that sorts this out properly.

You can right-click your favorites to do things like rename it or open it in a new tab. However, right-clicking a Reading List item only gives you the option to delete. Both of these context menus pale in comparison to the ones available in Internet Explorer 11, Chrome, and Firefox. For example, you cannot create a desktop shortcut of anything that you have favorited.

Setting a start page and tab behavior

Pretty much every browser defaults to opening a start page or a blank page. If you'd prefer that Edge open where you left off, you'll need to dig into your settings. Click the button with three dots in the upper right-hand corner -- it's labeled More Actions. Then click Settings at the bottom.

Be aware that there is no mechanism for returning your choices to default settings. So if you want to remember the original settings, take screenshots before you change anything.

With the Settings pane open, go to the Open With section and click Previous Pages. The next time you open Edge, it will reload the same tabs and pages you were looking at when you closed the program.

While you're here, you can change what happens when you open a new tab. The default is Top Sites, a grid of your most-accessed websites. This is the most useful selection for many of us, but feel free to experiment. You can also clear your browser history here.

Bonus tip: If you've accidentally closed a single tab instead of the whole browser, get it back by pressing Crtl-Shift-T. This shortcut is actually common to most browsers, but it's not well-known.

Managing your browsing history

If you want to look at your browsing history, Edge unfortunately does nothing when you right-click the Back button. Press Ctrl-H instead, which is a nearly universal shortcut for accessing browser history. If you prefer navigating there with a mouse, click the Hub button in the upper right, which has three horizontal lines on it, and click the History button, which looks like an analog clock face with a circular arrow going around it. (The names of these buttons appear when you hover your mouse pointer over them for a couple seconds.)

The X on the right-hand side deletes all history entries categorized under it, such as Last Hour, Last Day, and Older. Edge won't ask you to confirm this deletion, so be careful where you click. Choose Clear All History, however, and you'll see a menu of deletion choices. The Show More link reveals more clearing options, but most users don't need to mess with those.

When you want to close the History pane, click the Hub button above it or click an empty space on the webpage you're viewing. Ctrl-H does not close it. If you want to keep this pane open, click the thumbtack to ""pin"" it. Clicking the Hub button will still close the pane, even when it's pinned.

Advanced Settings: Home, forms, search, and more

Advanced Settings is the button at the bottom of the settings pane; you may have to scroll down to see it. But fear not, these ""advanced"" settings aren't really that technical. For example, you can toggle the presence of the Home button that you may have gotten used to in IE 11. You can also toggle pop-up blocking and the Adobe Flash player. If you have a third-party password manager, you can tell Edge to stop offering to remember your passwords. We do recommend using a password manager, because they can create strong passwords that you don't have to memorize.

Turning off Save Form Entries is usually a good idea if you're using the browser to send credit card information, home addresses, and other sensitive personal data. If an unauthorized user gains control of your device, they'll be able to dig that data up. The Do Not Track system is only moderately useful, because websites must agree not to track you. The dangerous websites are the ones that are least likely to accept this request.

By default, Microsoft Edge uses Bing when you search in the address bar. If you prefer Google, you must go to Google's website, then open Edge's settings pane again, scroll down to View Advanced Settings, click it, scroll down to the ""Search in the address bar with"" drop-down menu, click Bing to open the menu, click the choice labeled ""<Add new>,"" click www.google.com, and select ""Add as default."" Like fish in a barrel, right? Also, the ""Show search suggestions as I type"" toggle only works when Bing is the default search engine.

The last four options in Advanced Settings are probably fine with their default selections. If you start blocking cookies, websites may have trouble remembering your settings. Page prediction can improve browsing, but Edge has to send info about your browsing habits to Microsoft for that to work correctly. This info is more or less anonymous, as far as we know, but the privacy implications are enough to leave that toggle in the off position.

Sharing links

As a rule, mobile browsers have a sharing function so you can send a text message or email with the URL of what you're looking at on the Web. Oddly, desktop browsers usually don't have a sharing function. Edge is the exception, putting a share button in the upper-right corner, though you may not recognize it at first. Instead of the branching dot style adopted by most of the Internet, Edge's share button depicts dots connected in a circle.

In a fresh installation of Windows 10, you are limited to three sharing options: Twitter, the Mail app, and Microsoft OneNote. OneNote is digital journal that works like Google Keep. When you use OneNote with a Microsoft account, you can access your entries on other devices that use a Microsoft account and have OneNote installed. (Find out more about the difference between local and Microsoft accounts in the next section.)

To expand your Edge sharing options, fire up the Windows 10 app. There's no function in the sharing tool to do that. Instead, you press the Windows key or click the Start button in the lower left-hand corner of the screen and click the Store icon, which looks like a shopping bag. Unfortunately, you'll have some trial and error finding apps to add to Edge sharing, because Edge doesn't integrate search for Windows Store apps it can share with, and the Windows Store does not tag an app for compatibility with this function. For example, we found success with the Windows Store versions of Facebook and Poki for Pocket, but not with Viber, Line, or QQ. Right now there's not a Windows Store version of Skype for Windows 10, so it won't show up in Edge's list of apps it can use to share. On the bright side, when there is a Windows Store version of an app and it has a sharing function, it will show up in the sharing list immediately after it's installed -- no need to restart Edge or Windows 10.

The Windows Store and local accounts

Since Edge has some integration with the Windows Store, and this store may be the delivery mechanism for addons, there's a few things you should know about it. There are two ways to log in to a Windows 10 device: a local account and a Microsoft account. A Microsoft account logs you in automatically to Microsoft services like OneDrive, OneNote, and the Xbox Live app. And when you log in to your Microsoft account on another Windows 10 device, that device can automatically download all Windows Store apps associated with the account, making it easier for you to get up to speed. However, some users may not want to be logged in to a Microsoft data center for the duration of their session, despite the convenience.

Now when you download an app from the Windows Store, it will ask you to log in to your Microsoft account. If you are logging in to Windows with a local account, confirming your identity during the installation of a Windows Store app will switch your login from a local account to an Microsoft account. You can prevent this behavior and keep logging in locally, but it's a little tricky.

After you've logged into your Microsoft account as requested by the Windows Store, you'll see a window labeled ""Make it yours,"" where you are prompted to enter your local account password to confirm your identity. This is where you make the switch. Click instead on ""Sign in to just this app instead."" This will allow you to use the Windows Store app in the future without having to log in to a Microsoft account, unless the app is owned by Microsoft (OneDrive, Skype, and so on). And you can keep using your local account to log in to Windows 10.

Managing your downloads

Ctrl-J opens the pane that shows what you've downloaded with Edge -- again, a shortcut that performs the same function in Firefox and Chrome. Unlike the latter two browsers, Edge does not allow you to change your download destination from the Downloads folder on the C: drive. So you'll have to make sure that the size of your download does not exceed the available space on your C: drive. As with Edge's Favorites pane, there is no search function here or any sorting options. You get only reverse chronology. There is also no mechanism to open the destination folder with a specific file preselected for easy interaction. You can only open the Downloads folder. So if you have a lot of files in there, you'll have to use Windows 10's file browser functions to find it yourself.

If you click the X next to the download, that will remove the entry from the list, but the file will still be present in the Downloads folder. This is actually conventional behavior, but it's something to be aware of.

Known for its security software, Symantec on Tuesday launched a new program aimed at educating parents about their children's online usage. Norton Online Family, now available in beta, is a parental control suite with multiple levels of restriction and an emphasis on usage reporting.

(Credit: Symantec)

Citing a Rochester Institute of Technology study that found a huge gap between the percentage of parents versus children who report no online supervision, Symantec says that Online Family is intended to bridge that gap by ""fostering communication"" between parents and their kids. According to the RIT study, only 7 percent of parents think their children have no online supervision, while 66 percent of kids think they go unsupervised.

To address that, Online Family uses a desktop client called the Norton Safety Minder for Windows and Mac that reports to the parents' Norton Family account with options to e-mail notifications, too. Norton Online Family features parental-controlled customization levels based on the computer's user accounts, so that multi-child families can have different monitoring levels for different kids. It runs in the system tray, too, so that its presence is obvious to all users.

Online Family can log Web sites, block sites using both a topic blocker or a traditional blacklist, and report on social-networking activities. When it tracks visited Web sites, it automatically filters out advertisement URLs that get pinged when visiting media-rich sites. This makes the log easier to parse through.

Online Family includes some innovative features that lend credibility to the claim that this is more than just a souped-up keylogger or blacklist. The blocked sites feature, for example, can be set so that kids can ""appeal"" to their parents for approval via either e-mail or a Norton-based chat app. It can also be set so that it lets kids through to see the flagged site, regardless of parental approval, but then the parents' log flags the visited site. The responsibility of discussing the content, of course, is left up to parental discretion.

(Credit: Symantec)

Importantly, Online Family tracks how children represent themselves on social-networking sites, and alerts parents when a child misrepresents their age. Age misrepresentation, Symantec said, was often an indicator of a child associating with people or groups that the parents weren't aware of. It also keeps track of how long a kid has spent on a social-networking site, what time they log in and out, and how often they visit the site.

The new program monitors client-based instant messaging, too. This includes Google/Jabber, Yahoo, Microsoft Live, AOL, Skype, ICQ, Trillian's native chat protocol, as well as Trillian's multi-protocol features and Digsby's, too. However, site-based messaging can not be tracked. Once a child logs into Facebook, for example, Online Family won't be able to follow what they're doing within the site.

Other monitors include a personal information blocker, where personal information specific to the child can be blocked from being sent out from the computer, a parental notification whenever a kid creates a new account on any site, a time monitor to enforce a ""computer curfew,"" and a notification for when the Norton Safety Minder is turned off.

Online Family requires a Norton account, and the registration is free until the program leaves beta. Final pricing for the Online Family stable release that's expected in the spring has yet to be announced, but the beta trial is free for now. Symantec has said that they want to make Norton Online Family affordable, though, so it's unlikely that the price point will be exorbitant.",html

A new season of security suites is upon us, and Kaspersky has made improvements to its Kaspersky Internet Security and Kaspersky Anti-Virus programs that include changes indicative of where security software as an industry is leaning. Three new features along with expected upgrades to its antivirus engine keep Kaspersky competitive.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

The full-feature suite Kaspersky Internet Security offers a complete and competitive range of security options. The new features in the 2010 edition include a behavioral-based detection system called the Urgent Detection System. The UDS utilizes the anonymous data of 10 million Kaspersky customers who choose to participate in submitting their system scans to Kaspersky's central servers for analysis. In fact, the UDS must be opted-out of--there's a check box and data collection statement to read when you install the program.

Although this might sound insidious, it's actually a smart way to leverage a huge consumer base for security purposes as long as the data remains anonymous. Symantec's Norton 2010 will contain a behavioral check, too, and what both do is look at programs installed on your computer and judge their safety based on how many people have them installed and how they behave. Among UDS's better sub-features are the ability to customize how long it takes to pass judgment on a new program and per-user configuration of the rules governing program behavior.

Even if a program has deep penetration and it starts behaving badly, Kaspersky will block it. If it's an unknown, Kaspersky will treat it skeptically, monitoring and restricting the program until it has been proven safe. The Vulnerability Scan option, available under the Scan tab, utilizes tech from Secunia to determine which programs are potential security risks because they lack recent updates or patches. For programs that may not warn you that they have a pending security update, such as Adobe Flash, having this tool baked-in could be exceptionally useful.

The tools offered under the My Protection tab are nothing short of robust. There's antivirus protection for files, e-mail, HTTP traffic, and instant messaging. Application control, the aforementioned UDS, includes options for customization, should you need to force access for a specific program that Kaspersky is identifying as a threat. There are protections against spam, phishing, and banner ads, firewall control, and a network monitor to track network activities for users who like to drill down deep into their system's behavior. There's also a Parental Control filter, with options to outright block children from particular sites or merely log events. By default, the Parental Control filter is off, and when activated it assigns all other users on the computer Child status until directed otherwise. There's a Teenager status, as well, for more granular control of restrictions.

The My Security Zone tab is where most of the application control features live. From here, a clean chart organizes your installed programs according to trustworthiness, the Digital Identity Protection feature allows you to uncover which files your personal information resides in according to program, and the Safe Run sandbox can be controlled. Safe Run nearly doubles the amount of RAM the program uses, but provides a secure environment for launching a program. Safe Run also comes with a sandboxed folder into which you can save files without worry. The feature currently will not run on Windows 7 computers, but Kaspersky has told me that it expects to have the feature fixed before the October release of the new operating system.

Programs can be launched into Safe Run in one of two ways. You can add the program manually through the Kaspersky Security Zone panel, or you can launch it on the fly using the context menu. Hopefully, there will be casual launcher added to jump lists in Windows 7, but that feature doesn't exist now.

Scans and definition file updates performed empirically as expected, with the Quick Scan taking less than three minutes. The Vulnerability Scan took less than four minutes, as well. The Full Scan, which was expected to be slow, took less than an hour, but as it approached 80 percent completion it oscillated between telling me that it would finish in one minute and two minutes. In fact, it would take another 11 minutes to finish.

The Update Center tab offers a smooth update scheduler integrated into the main interface. Click on Run Mode to change the schedule. This isn't remarkable except to point out that only the definition file update offers an update like this. To schedule any other regular scan, you must click on the Settings option at the top right of the main Kaspersky window, choose the feature you want to schedule from the list on the left if it wasn't open in the main window when you hit settings, select Settings from within the window that opens, and then finally click the Run Mode tab on yet one final pop-up window. It's a tedious process and could be streamlined to great effect, but makes one of the basic features of this security program unnecessarily hard to get to.

The program also comes with an auto-run disable feature and a virtual keyboard so that you can enter in passwords without worrying about a keylogger. I think most users will find this superfluous. The new gamer mode, however, isn't. This basically keeps Kaspersky functioning while you play games but kills interrupting pop-ups and strips memory usage down to its minimum.

If you're testing the trial version, a yellow bar announcing that your computer security is at risk can be toggled under the Report link at the top right of the main window, then go to the Status tab.

Full benchmarks from the CNET Labs were not available when this blog originally ran, but we have them now. CNET Labs' benchmarks reveal a slightly different side to KIS. KIS slowed down our test computer's cold boot time by 2.21 seconds, and shutdown time by nearly 5 seconds. Scan times were actually faster on Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 than Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2010 by 9 seconds. They have identical engines, but KAV has fewer ancillary features. During our MS Office and iTunes decoding tests, both KIS and KAV performed identically, although during the media multitasking test KIS was slower by 64 seconds. In our Cinebench test, KIS fared the worst compared to a standard machine and KAV. KIS hit 3,908, while KAV notched 4,190 and baseline computer marked 4,217.

According to virus and malware detection results at AV-Test.org and AV-Comparatives.org, last year's Kaspersky 2009 has scored average or better in all areas of detection. AV-Test.org noted that it detected more than 98.4 percent of malware on demand and 98.3 percent of spyware on demand, with an average rate of false positives. AV-Comparitives.org awarded Kaspersky 2009 Advanced+ in both February 2009's on-demand comparative and in May 2009's retrospective/pro-active test, noting few false positives and a 50 percent detection rate, behind Microsoft, Eset, Avira, and G Data. The short version of these independent test results is that last year's Kaspersky scored above average in general, and was excellent at malware detection.

If you're interested only in Kaspersky Anti-Virus, it contains the most of the same engines and features as Kaspersky Internet Security. It lacks the personal two-way firewall, parental and privacy control, whitelisting and application control, safe run virtual sandbox, antispam protection, and banner ad blocking.

Using this year's interface and detection numbers for the previous version, I think it's safe to say that Kaspersky is a strong security suite, but that the extra features available in Internet Security make it worthwhile to pay for, whereas the standard Kaspersky Anti-Virus doesn't offer enough on its own to compare favorably against high-performing, free antivirus programs.",html

Such is the case with Intuit's latest offering in the form of Quicken 2011, which is available starting today in a choice of three versions: Starter Edition ($29.95), Deluxe ($59.95), and Premier ($89.95).

(Credit: Intuit)

It's immediately apparent that Intuit's acquisition of Mint last year has had a positive effect on the Quicken update. For one, the start-up process has been noticeably streamlined when compared with the previous version. Those who are setting up a profile for the first time can add accounts in just three screens as opposed to five or more; a process that used to take an hour now takes 15 to 20 minutes, depending on how many accounts you have. In preliminary testing, I added four bank accounts and one credit card in just over 20 minutes, and that included some glitchiness from one of the banks.

The time and work required by the user overall is also vastly reduced in the latest version of Quicken, thanks to the fact that the program can now automatically download data from more than 12,000 banks, brokerages, and loans. (That number in the previous edition was 5,000.) For most, this will eliminate the need to download Quicken-compatible statements or input data manually. The app will also now automatically detect transfers between accounts, so it's no longer necessary for users to keep tabs on and correct this data.

Plus, the software implements new technology from Mint that has improved overall categorization of transactions. According to Inuit, it's now 90-percent accurate, versus 55-percent in the 2010 version. This makes budgeting a lot easier, and it provides detailed insight on spending habits.

Another marked improvement in Quicken 2011 is the modernized user interface, which is less cluttered along the top and simpler to navigate overall. For example, the transaction registers for the previous version were plain white boxes, with nothing to delineate different transactions. Now, there are iTunes-like blue-and-white outlines to separate each occurrence. And you can sort and resize columns, which was a rather glaring UI oversight in past versions.

So which Quicken is for you? For casual users who want to get a handle on spending, well...it's probably just as well to stick with the free offering at Mint.com. Unless, of course, you want desktop software, in which case the Starter Edition is the right pick. The Deluxe version adds more options for creating a savings plan (including a handy cash flow graph), while Premier offers investment tools as well.",html

Fulfilling a pledge to hasten the pace of Chrome releases, Google has issued its first beta edition of Chrome 7, but the big new changes in the browser come with a new developer-oriented release.

The new beta, Chrome 7.0.517.24, matches that of Tuesday's developer-channel release. That doesn't include too much directly visible to users--the about:labs feature for experimental options is one item--but it paves the way for major changes.

For a preview of those coming attractions, browser users should check the new developer version that's been cooking for weeks, version 7.0.536.2. The new features include the activation by default of the WebGL 3D graphics technology, an option for built-in Google Instant search results, and some hardware acceleration for some CSS transformations, a way of handling dynamic changes using the Cascading Style Sheets formatting standard.

""A lot of the work that's being done in 7.0 is largely not user facing and in some cases is a legitimate work in progress,"" said Chrome team member Anthony Laforge in a response to comments criticizing the version 7 release as insufficiently novel. ""With our new release cycle and about:labs, I'd suggest you stay tuned, things are going to start moving quite fast.""

screenshot by Stephen Shankland/CNET

The first feature enabled through about:labs is a new ability to show all tabs through an Expose-like feature on Mac OS X and to show tabs vertically on the left side of the browser on Windows. Those who wanted a three-finger downward swipe on a Mac trackpad to jump to the bottom of a Web page, as Firefox does, will be disappointed to find that gesture activates the tab Expose view.

Also through about:labs, Windows gets an upgrade to the omnibox, the dual-purpose address and search bar, so it shows the search-as-you-type behavior of Google Instant. It's awkward at this stage--the omnibox drop-down covers the top search results--but doubtless it'll improve.

A lot more hardware acceleration is on the way, but don't necessarily expect it to arrive for Chrome 7. Mozilla and Microsoft, the top two browser makers, have been racing to build hardware acceleration into their browsers as well.

The about:labs mechanism, which parallels Firefox's about:config option as an easier way to change under-the-hood browser settings, will be getting more exercise in the future. One item coming to about:labs is 2D Graphics acceleration, for example. For now, about:labs changes require a browser restart.

The last time the beta version passed a major milestone was August 11 with Chrome 6. Google is aiming to release new versions every six weeks, roughly double the earlier pace.",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-10436072-12.html,"Avast 5 gets a new look, finally","January,Am,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Freeware antivirus Avast 5 debuts today with several new features, but longtime fans are most likely to notice that the old interface has gone to wherever interfaces go when they die. Along with the new interface, Avast Free, Avast Professional, and the new Avast Internet Security introduce an overhauled feature set that keeps the suite highly competitive. Arguably, the free version provides the most complete free antivirus on the market.

Before detailing the new features, the importance of this interface change can't be understated. Gone is the music player default look, which was skinnable but confusing. In its place is a sleek user interface that new users should find far more manageable. The gray and orange color scheme stands out well on the screen, and the tab-based navigation on the left makes it much easier than before to navigate between features. Highlighted with the familiar security colors of green for safe and red for dangerous, the Summary tab gives up-to-date info on shield status, auto-updates, virus definitions, the program version, and whether the new silent/gaming mode is on. There's also an unobtrusive ad to Avast Internet Security.

The Summary tab contains a second submenu, Statistics. If you're curious to see how Avast's shields have been performing against threats, here's where you can get your math geek on. For each shield, it tells you how many files were scanned and when, and presents the data in a concise graph.

The scans live in the second tab, where you can choose and adjust six default scan types plus a custom scan option. What's useful about Avast's layout here is that you can adjust all Avast-related scans from this tab. This includes the expected Quick and Full scans, but also encompasses the Removable media scan, Folder scan, Scans initiated from Windows Explorer, and the Screen Saver scan. Once you initiate a scan, you're not locked into that pane. Exploring the program interface while a scan runs doesn't kill the scan.

You can also schedule a boot-time scan and access scan logs from the scan tab. While running a scan, Avast will tell you not only how long the scan has taken and how many files have been examined, but also how much data has been tested and how fast it's being tested. As with the summary graphs, there's a lot of data that Avast exposes.

The Real-Time Shields live in the third tab, and again the clean interface comes into play here as navigating what could be a mess of options and tweaks is instead dead simple. Click on a shield to reveal a real-time chart of what it's been defending you against, with a Stop button and settings options at the top of the window. Another button at the top takes you to the advanced settings for that shield, and links at the bottom expose the shield's history as a graph and export a log file.

The last tab, Maintenance, contains the virus chest and manual update buttons. On the top right of the interface live the Help Center and the Settings, from which you can get much more granular control of Avast. This includes everything from toggling the system tray icon, to managing updates, to password-protecting Avast access. This is also where you can uninvolve your anonymously submitted data from Community IQ, the Avast crowd-sourced behavioral detection engine. The new Avast interface is also Aero-friendly, with Explorer-style backward and forward navigation buttons in case you can't remember where you tweaked a particular setting. If the interface turned you off before, Avast 5 is worth another look just to see how much it's improved.

The basic free version, formerly known as the Home Edition, includes an attractive and obviously affordable set of features. The antivirus, antispyware, and heuristics engines form a security core that also includes multiple real-time shields. Mail and file system shields join the preexisting behavior, network, instant messaging, peer-to-peer, and Web shields. Other new features include a silent-gaming mode and an ""intelligent scanner"" that only looks at changed files after establishing a baseline.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

The behavioral shield is a common-sense feature, as security software publishers leverage their large user bases to detect threats early and warn others. Avast's user base is interesting in that it's heavily involved in the support of the software, and the company claims that its mostly volunteer-run support forums see 100,000 daily visitors. This isn't surprising, though, given that Avast passed the 100-million-user mark at the end of 2009.

There are several features that are only available in both the Professional and Internet Security versions. The Pro version, which comes with a single-computer license for $39.95, offers a script shield and a sandbox for isolating and testing suspected threats, without having to worry about infection. The Internet Security version gives users three licenses for $59.95, and includes a firewall and antispam measures along with the sandbox and script shield.

Efficacy testing of antivirus programs is becoming trickier as threats mutate beyond what the tests have been designed to check, but some testing is better than none. In the Whole Product Dynamic Test by independent efficacy tester AV-Comparitives in December 2009, which tested a beta version of Avast 5, the program earned an Advanced rating. Although it shared that score with six others, including Eset and the free programs from Microsoft and Avira, only two programs scored higher: Norton and Kaspersky.

In November 2009, Avast 4.8 and Microsoft Security Essentials were the only freeware to score Advanced+ in the Retrospective/Proactive Test done by AV Comparatives. Avast 4.8 was also the only program that tested faster than Norton AntiVirus 2010, and was tied with Microsoft for second place in fewest false positives detected. The detection score was also high, at 98 percent. That's worse than Avira, but Avast noted far fewer false positives. Avast 5 Free lacks features in the paid upgrade including antispam measures, a testing sandbox, a Script shield, and a firewall. Even without those, Avast Free 5 probably the strongest, free antivirus currently available.

CNET Labs is currently performing its own tests, and the results will be added here when they're available. In an empirical real-world test, though, the Quick scan took 13 minutes, 52 seconds, while a Full scan ran about 90 minutes.

Users should also note that along with offering an opt-in to Google Chrome when installing Avast, the free version was also chosen last week to be part of the Google Pack in Europe.

Though it's clear that the paid versions of Avast represent a good value, albeit not the best value, the efficacy, feature set, and ease of use of Avast Free make it a must-have security suite.",html

Firefox Aurora 6 can be downloaded for Windows, Mac, Linux, and like its Google counterpart Chrome dev, it offers fewer major changes than what people are used to, but it offers them more often.

(Credit: Mozilla)

In a blog post, Mozilla said that this first release of Firefox Aurora 6 includes an improved add-ons manager that comes with a plugin check verification tool built in. This means that plugins like Adobe Flash will automatically get checked to ensure that they are up-to-date. There's also a new Groups On Demand feature for Panorama, which ought to improve browser start times by loading saved groups only when using the tab grouping feature. Power users also get a new data management window for fine-tuning control that individual Web sites have over your browsing data like cookies, passwords, and location information. It's accessible by typing ""about:permissions"" into the location bar.

Developers see some love in Aurora 6, too. The new Scratchpad lets developers quickly build and test JavaScript snippets, similar to Chrome. The Web Console can now be moved around or even broken out into a separate window, just like a tab; and the Web Developer Menu concentrates access to the developer tools from the Firefox menu button in one place.

Other developer support enhancements in Aurora 6 include server-sent events, better HTML5, and DOM level 3.",html

Chrome 11 (download for Windows | Mac | Linux) comes with the ability to convert your speech to text, which could prove to be a big boon to people who have difficulty with keyboards as well as providing on the go translations when used with Google Translate.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

The new feature, based in HTML5, requires a microphone icon embedded in the Web page. Click the icon and then speak into your computer's mic. The input records as text, and the browser automatically inserts the text into the available form field.

You can test this by going to Google Translate and clicking the microphone icon in the lower right corner of the text field. At the time of writing, the microphone and voice-to-HTML feature appears to work only with English.

While the feature is interesting to include in a browser, it's hardly a random decision on Google's part. By including a speech-to-text feature, the Chrome OS instantly provides a modicum of accessibility for users who have difficulty with keyboards. When the browser is the operating system, being able to speak to the computer and have the computer know how to interpret that speech is a quick way to ensure a broader appeal.

Other changes in Chrome 11 include the introduction of hardware accelerated 3D CSS, bug fixes in cloud print, a security update to the built-in version of Adobe Flash, and user agent string changes introduced to bring Chrome in line with user agent changes made in Firefox 4. The jump from Chrome 11 beta to stable also includes 25 security changes, including 15 marked as high risk. These fixes cover potential risks such as URL bar spoofing during navigation errors, and numerous instances of stale pointers in PDF forms, sandboxing, and drop-down list handling.

Google has been moving forward with its less stable versions of Chrome too. It recently bumped Google Chrome Canary version 13 (Windows download only), the first version of Chrome to reach that milestone. Chrome Canary 13 doesn't appear to have any features different from Chrome dev 12 at this time.

Google Chrome dev 12.0.742.9 (download for Windows | Mac | Linux) includes tweaks to the Sync interface, introduces a new version of the V8 JavaScript engine, and has been offering a still-in-development feature that lets users select multiple tabs at once. There's also an experimental ""new tab"" page, which users can activate through the about:flags configuration screen, and a multiple profile option for having different user profiles under the same Windows log-in. Currently, this is available only on the Windows version of Chrome dev, though like speech-to-HTML it has bigger implications for Chrome OS.",html

When a deluge of customers hit the Web on Tuesday morning to preorder the iPhone 4, many reported errors in the online ordering process.

A number of them took to Twitter to report that the process of preordering would stall halfway through giving error messages like the one pictured above.

It's not clear if the problem is on AT&T's end or if Apple's site is just overloaded. When ordering through Apple.com, the order process stalls when it comes to the time for a current subscriber's account to be verified through AT&T. But the process also sometimes hangs in other places, according to reports.

Apple's customer service phone lines appear to be equally overloaded. The recorded message when calling 1-800-MY-APPLE says that due to ""extremely high call volumes"" they're not currently taking new calls.

Several Gizmodo readers reported security issues with AT&T's iPhone ordering site. When the preorder process stalled and they refreshed the page, they say they were rerouted to someone else's account.

Apple has not responded to requests for comment. AT&T declined to comment.

Nathan Peck, 34, tried preordering the new iPhone 4 Tuesday morning from home. He tried AT&T's Web site and Apple's Web site and kept getting errors. So he walked around the corner from his Upper West Side apartment in New York City to the local AT&T store.

He wasn't alone. At 2 p.m. EDT on Tuesday afternoon, the queue to preorder a phone at the 95th and Broadway AT&T store in Manhattan was 20 people deep. Peck was told he'd have to wait at least 45 minutes before he could be helped. The AT&T salesperson signing people in at the crowded store said the company was no longer allowing people to preorder the iPhone 4 online via the AT&T Web site. She said all preorders through AT&T would have to be entered manually at the store by an AT&T sales associate. She gave no reason for the glitch or long line, but simply added names to the list on her clipboard as one person after another came into the store.

""I don't stand in line for many things,"" said Peck, who wants to upgrade from his iPhone 3G to the new iPhone 4. ""I thought by preordering I'd avoid all the craziness of getting the phone on the first day. But it seems like preordering is just as bad as waiting in line on the first day. ""

Frustration with iPhone ordering isn't new: AT&T and Apple had widespread problems with the huge number of activations of the iPhone when it was first released in 2007, as well as in 2008, and, though less so, in 2009. But this is the first time the preorder process has experienced such a delay.

Another surprise in the preorder process: Although Apple announced last week that the iPhone 4 would come in two sizes (16GB and 32GB) and two colors (black and white), as of Tuesday morning, the site states that only the black model may be preordered. The white model just says ""currently unavailable.""

Besides Apple and AT&T, RadioShack and Best Buy are also places to preorder the latest iPhone, which officially goes on sale June 24.

http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20093070-12/new-firefox-6-belies-rapid-release-complaints/,New Firefox 6 belies rapid-release complaints,"August,Am,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Mozilla pushed Firefox 6 out the door today, updating the vast majority of its users to the browser's latest stable build.

Firefox 6 is available to download for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android. This is the second stable version of the browser to arrive under the new rapid-release cycle, which promises a new stable build of Firefox every 6 weeks. As such, the changes to the browser are smaller in nature, and are more likely to be about stability and security concerns. However, Mozilla has taken the opportunity of this second stable rapid release to also address complaints from fans who want version numbers ""to mean something,"" to summarize the tone and gist of many CNET readers.

Firefox users aren't the only ones with concerns. Competitors, such as Opera, have a vested interest in opposing the rapid-release cycle, which puts the browser in the news cycle far more often than before. ""Web developers and IT administrators have expressed concern about the pace of new browser releases from Chrome and Firefox. We believe in a more balanced pace,"" said Jan Standal, vice president of desktop products for Opera Software.

While Mozilla did not address the complaints directly, it did release two new infographics detailing how the rapid-release cycle works. (Both are in QuickTime TIFF format and are reproduced here.) It also made several statements focusing on the future of Firefox.

""The next generation of innovation on the Web will be anchored by a browser that is an honest broker committed to the interests of the individual user and developer, providing amazing experiences that match those offered by proprietary platforms; and user control and developer reach and freedom that is superior to proprietary platforms. As Firefox has transformed the browser landscape before, it must do so again,"" wrote Jay Sullivan, vice president of products for Mozilla.

Whether Mozilla can do that is another story. Almost certainly, the company's recent announcement about making a Firefox-based mobile operating system will play a huge role in its attempts. ""There's no reason why 'apps' can't incorporate the characteristics that are important about the Web. They don't today because Apple didn't build them that way. There's no reason Apple should; Apple has a different view of the world. But we can,"" said Mitchell Baker, chairman of the Mozilla Foundation.

As for the browser that was released today, Firefox 6 for desktops and laptops contains a number of important stability fixes, as well as some feature improvements, most of which are aimed at developers. There's a new Web Developer menu in Firefox 6, which collates tools for building and debugging Web sites into one location. These include the new Scratchpad tool, which browsers like Opera and Chrome have had for some time. It allows developers to test JavaScript before implementing it. The Web console feature also has a new auto-complete option and can have its location customized.

The browser's visual tab-grouping feature that was introduced in Firefox 4 now only loads the active tab group. Mozilla said in the blog post announcing Firefox 6 that this will cut down on overall browser load times. The ""identity block,"" the colored left-most section of the URL, has been given a refresh to better call out the Web site you're on, and the URL bar itself now changes the text color of the URL you're on so that the domain is black, for easy identification, while the rest of the URL is gray. This is a small security change, and one that's been previously available to people who are comfortable changing their about:config, but it's definitely a strong visual cue that helps you avoid getting spoofed. Several security bugs labeled ""critical"" have also been fixed, repairing holes related to memory management, heap overflows, and unsigned scripts.

HTML5 also gets some love in Firefox 6, with improvements and additional support for the new Window.matchMedia API for Web optimization, and WebSockets and server-sent APIs for building more interactive and responsive real-time Web-based apps and games.

While some minor improvements were made to desktop Firefox's memory management in this release, fans will have to wait another six weeks to see the significant gains that Mozilla programmer Nicholas Nethercote wrote about last week.

The Android version of Firefox 6 includes a new Welcome page and a new look for phones running Android 2.3 Gingerbread. The browser now supports IndexedDB for storing Web pages in a local database, enabling the Android version to work better when offline. Mozilla also says the browser will start up faster and use less memory. The first of several planned changes to support tablets have arrived in this version, too, including font and icon optimization for tablets.

Several blogs have reported in recent days that free Android phone tethering apps that are typically found in the Android Market are not available for Android phones on AT&T, Verizon Wireless, and T-Mobile USA.

Sprint customers apparently are still able to access many of these tethering apps from the Android Market.

Reports first surfaced from the blog DroidLife that the free tethering app Wireless Tether could not be downloaded onto AT&T and Verizon Wireless handsets.

AT&T and Verizon representatives declined to comment, and said that Google chooses which apps are in the Android Market. Neither company would comment on whether they asked Google to remove the Wireless Tether app or any other free tethering app from the Android Market.

A Google spokesman told Fierce Wireless that it is not blocking the app. Instead it's simply making it unavailable for download on certain carrier networks at the request of those carriers. If an application is in direct violation of the terms and conditions of a usage contract, a carrier can request Google make the app unavailable, the spokesman told Fierce Wireless.

In essence, the apps are still on the Google Market, but they are just not visible to users on certain carrier networks. Apps are only hidden from view if they are in direct violation of the carrier's terms of service.

But that doesn't mean that AT&T, Verizon Wireless, and T-Mobile customers can't get access to these apps. Any app can still be side-loaded onto the device. So if the developer distributes the application file in a way other than the Android Market (say, just as a download from a Web site) a user can install that on his device.

AT&T has recently made a big push to ensure that people pay to use its smartphones as wireless modems. AT&T has been sending e-mails warning users who are tethering their phones without paying the extra fee. AT&T charges $20 extra per month for the tethering feature. Customers who tether are given 4GB of data to use during the month. Customers who exceed that limit are charged $10 a gigabyte thereafter.

T-Mobile USA charges $15 a month in addition to a smartphone data plan for 5GB worth of data per month. And Verizon Wireless charges its smartphone customers $20 a month on top of its $30 smartphone data fee to use up to 2GB of data per month.",html

","TweetDeck drops AIR, goes native","December,Pm,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

The new TweetDeck (download for Windows and Mac) has launched, and it's the first version since Twitter bought the company. There's a new logo and blue skin to reflect that, but far bigger changes happened under the hood.

It's not entirely clear when the new versions were released, since Twitter didn't announce them, but the company has completely abandoned the old program. Gone is the cross-platform program built on Adobe AIR, and gone are many of its features. In its place, Twitter has built two new programs native to Windows and Mac, respectively, and streamlined their functionality to more closely reflect the official Twitter workflow. TweetDeck is still available as a Chrome Web App, and for iOS and Android, although they haven't recent an upgrade like the Windows and Mac clients.

Before its purchase, TweetDeck had released native clients alongside the AIR version, but the new releases appear unrelated.

The basics of TweetDeck's functions remain, including multiple Twitter and Facebook account support and customizable columns, while new-Twitter style retweeting and direct messaging have been improved. There's also separate columns for Facebook newsfeeds and Facebook notifications.

Old TweetDeck users can log in with their TweetDeck accounts to save the trouble of re-entering in multiple account usernames and passwords.

Facebook is now the only non-Twitter account that TweetDeck supports. MySpace, LinkedIn, Foursquare, and Google Buzz have all been dropped. The loss of Buzz is not exactly catastrophic, but it does indicate that Twitter isn't about to drop its hard line on cross-social network pollination. Also gone are color and font customizations, keyboard shortcuts, URL shortening service options, and TweetDeck's tweaks to minimize API calls.

Notification box moving still exists, but now you simply grab it when it appears and drag it to the part of the screen you want it to be in. That's a definite improvement over the weird X-Y axis widget in the old TweetDeck's settings.

Overall, I found the new TweetDeck experience to be better than the old one. There's less behavioral wonkiness, and it feels like it's natural extension of Twitter. However, dropping support for all accounts besides Twitter and Facebook doesn't bode well for people who have their hopes up for Google Plus integration.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-27076_3-20011531-248.html,'Tab Candy' to bring calm to Firefox's tab chaos,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Mozilla's head of user experience for its Labs unit, Aza Raskin, on Friday unveiled a new project called ""Tab Candy"" that promises to dramatically change the way users manage open browser tabs.

Tab Candy is not an extension, but a new feature that Raskin and team plan to build into a future version of the Firefox browser. In essence, it creates a desktop-like workspace for users to separate and organize open tabs into groups. When opened, these groups act like their own instance of the browser. So, say you had grouped together 5 of 50 open tabs, then opened that group through Tab Candy; you'd only see those 5 in your browser, and not the other 45. You could then jump back and forth between the main grouping and other subgroups--all without having to keep open (or track of) various Firefox windows.

Raskin is keen to note that this level of organization makes it much easier to manage open tabs on devices with smaller screen like Netbooks. The same concept could also be applied to Mozilla's mobile browser efforts, where screen real estate is hard to find.

The concept is still in development, and only available in an experimental version of Firefox, which Raskin has made available for brave alpha testers. Right now it's only feature is this tab organization, though many more features are coming, including search, clusters that can be set as a private browsing session, and public and private sharing of tab groups. Beyond that, Raskin envisions blending in Firefox's extensions functionality to add extra utility to Tab Candy's tab clusters, as well as implementing a memory saving feature that will put long unused tabs into hibernation so they don't suck up memory. Raskin details some of these concepts in the below demo video:

It's an unusual space to be in at the moment, because while malicious mobile apps have been proven to exist and indeed are legitimate threats, there's very few of them for one simple reason: there's no money in it. At least, not yet.

You can bet your last horse bound for the glue factory that as phones replace credit cards and are increasingly used to conduct transactions, the threats will increase. App makers aren't waiting around, either, and already there are some major Windows security players moving into the Android market. Many of them don't have fully baked, stable releases, but some do. We've reviewed three of the better-known apps that are ready to safeguard your phone: AVG Antivirus, Lookout Mobile Security, and Trend Micro Mobile Security. (Check out our comparison chart.)

Generally, these three compare favorably against each other, although there are definite differences. DroidSecurity was the original publisher of AVG's app, and so the look and feel of AVG Antivirus for Android has very little to do with the desktop application. Expect that to change in the coming year, but for now they seem to share only a company logo.

The features in AVG's app are similar though not identical to Lookout's app. Lookout has been garnering massive attention in the Android world, to the point where it's been featured on several Android television commercials. The app has more going for it than a good PR firm; Lookout has been developing its App Genome Project, a real-time database of verified legitimate apps and their security implications to further bolster the Lookout app's bonafides.

AVG and Lookout share common features beyond their scanning tools. Both have a lost phone locator, a must-have feature for mobile devices, although the implementation is different between them. Lookout's implementation feels more polished thanks to a stronger Web site design, and where Lookout offers an on-demand car alarm-style ""scream"" deterrent, AVG lets you send custom messages to the screen. However, AVG's remote lock and wipe are included in the free version, which Lookout reserves for its premium customers.

Both also offer backups, again with different implementations. Lookout restricts content backup beyond contacts to premium users, while AVG users get free access to backups for text messages, bookmarks, system settings, application settings, call logs, as well as contacts. Despite fewer features being offered in the free version, Lookout's implementation is preferable for several reasons. One is that AVG's backup covers much of the same ground that other free backup utilities or options can help you with, such as contacts and bookmarks, without backing up many people's most prized possession: their photos. Settings and text backup without having to root the phone is an excellent feature, though, and so I'd place the two apps on equal footing.

Trend Micro stands slightly apart from AVG and Lookout. It doesn't have a phone locator service, although it does offer parental controls and a solid call and text message blocking system. It also ports its Smart Protection Network from the desktop to the phone, running Web sites you look at in the default browser through a safety check without slowing down your device. Unfortunately, the SPN doesn't yet support other browsers, such as Dolphin, Firefox, or Opera.

Another difference with Trend Micro is that it's not free. Like the desktop version, you get a 30-day, unencumbered free trial, after which a license costs $3.99. Upgrading AVG will set you back $9.99, while Lookout Premium commands a premium of $29.99 per year.

All three will enhance the basic level of security on your phone, and all three have strong added-value features. However, when it comes to app verification and lost phone locator implementation, my two biggest concerns, Lookout jumps to the top of my list.",html
http://homeinstallation.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-20118920-233/apple-ios-5-review-modest-but-definitely-worthwhile/,"Apple iOS 5 review: Modest, but definitely worthwhile",,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Now Playing: Watch this: Apple's iOS 5

At long last, iOS 5 is finally here, two days before the launch of the iPhone 4S.

(Related: We've heard that a number of users have had problems installing the update. Get the latest news on install issues in this post from CNET's Josh Lowensohn.)

Though iOS 5 is not as drastic of an upgrade as we saw with iOS 4 in June 2010, it does offer some much-needed and exciting enhancements for iOS users. A few are quiet and long overdue and others will seriously change how you use your Apple handset.

On that note, perhaps the biggest of all is the addition of over-the-air updates, which obviate the need to tether your iPhone to a computer for syncing. But there's a lot more under the hood with this upgrade, and we think users should be excited to plug in their iDevice one last time. iMessage also adds a new way to keep in touch and a way to circumvent your carrier's monthly allotment of messages.

A few improvements simply make the user experience easier, like Twitter integration in the major Apple apps, basic image-editing tools for the camera, and a Notification system paired with reminders that keep you informed with a glance at your Home screen. Smaller upgrades abound, of course, some of which we've listed here. We haven't found all the ""Easter eggs,"" though, so as you find other changes, let us know in the comments.

We've documented many of the major changes here, but we tried to limit our coverage to the big tweaks that will affect users most. Apple says there are more than 200 new tweaks for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch, and we'll be covering many more of the minor changes with features and How To posts in the coming weeks.

Available for free, iOS 5 will be compatible with the iPhone 4S, the iPhone 4, the iPhone 3GS , both versions of the iPad, and the third- and fourth-generation models of the iPod Touch. Keep in mind that the quality of iOS 5 may vary by device. When Apple released iOS 4 last year, many iPhone 3G users complained of degraded device performance after they downloaded the update (one group even filed a lawsuit). Apple mostly fixed the issues with the release of iOS 4.2, but we'll be taking a close look as to how iOS 5 fares on the 3GS.

Notifications

Instead of pop-up menus that interrupt your work, a new Notification Center will combine messages, missed calls, app updates, a stock ticker, and the current weather in a single place. You can access it by swiping your finger downward from the top of the screen, and notifications will appear on the lock screen as well. You then can jump directly to the related feature for each notification and delete items by tapping the small X next to each line.

Though not exactly original--the pull-down menu has long been a hallmark feature of Android--the ability to see all notifications in one place in iOS 5 is certainly welcome. Since the first iPhone's debut more than four years ago, the iOS notification system has remained largely unchanged so we were long overdue for an upgrade. While simple, in the pre-iOS 5 world, the current application running is unusable until you dismiss the message. Even worse, several messages in a row quickly become annoying. We think iOS users will appreciate this small, but time-saving change. Check back later this week to see how these notification features compare with Android.

Newsstand

This app will bring together magazine subscriptions in a central place. The concept is similar to iBooks, even down to an icon that looks like the periodicals shelf at your local library. As you subscribe to a publication through a new channel in the App Store, new issues are delivered in the background, eliminating the need to manually grab them when they publish.

Newstand's success on the iPhone depends largely on how much reading you do on the smaller device, and how much digital content you purchased through Apple, but it's a great way to have content you like delivered to you. iPad users will probably benefit most with the added screen real estate and reading magazines on your iPad will now be easier than ever. Worth noting is that Apple's done something interesting with this app, letting it expand into a user's home screen, just like a folder of applications. The company doesn't let third-party apps do this. All of the Newsstand features will become available at launch. We will add to this portion of the review when we learn more.

Twitter

Thankfully, users now will be able to post photos to the social networking service without leaving the image gallery or camera application. It's a nice change, given that it will end the need to take a photo, switch to the iPhone Twitter app, and then post the photo. You'll be able to add a location, sync Twitter with your contacts list, and tweet directly from YouTube, Safari, and Maps.

When you send your first tweet from any of the designated apps, you can enter your Twitter info or create a new account. You'll also have the option to download the free Twitter client from within the sign-in screen--probably part of the deal Apple set up with Twitter to get integration into iOS 5. While there are third-party apps that might be a better choice as your Twitter client (iOS 5 Twitter integration does not include browsing Twitter), we think users will appreciate the ability to quickly send a tweet.

Safari

The mobile version of Apple's Web browser now has the Reader option that was announced at the 2010 WWDC. Rather than having to deal with complicated layouts of various Web sites, the reader streamlines multipage articles in a RSS-like view while stripping out ads, but leaving photos. You also can e-mail the entire text of a Safari page to a contact (under iOS 4, you could send only a link).

The Reader option is fantastic for reading strangely formatted Web pages, giving you a clear and iOS optimized layout for reading articles. We think people will be especially happy to finally get away from reading Web sites meant for a desktop computer, when there is no mobile option available. Our only problem with the Reader is that it may strip out too much--we often want to see comments on an article, but the Reader deems them unnecessary.

In other Safari news, tabbed browsing is now available on the iPad and you can add a Web page to a Reading List list for future perusal on any iOS device. The latter feature keeps a story on your reading list until you have time to read it, and it can be synced between multiple Safari devices. Be sure to check out our post exploring iOS 5 on the iPad from Donald Bell.

Reminders

This handy addition lets you store multiple to-do lists with dates for each event; you can categorize reminders by GPS location. So, for example, if you have a reminder of ""Call home when I leave work,"" the app will use GPS to note when you're on the move and send the reminder via push notification. Reminders can be shared between devices and sync with iCal on the Mac with CalDAV, and on Windows with MS Exchange. The app has its own sleek-looking scrollable calendar as well, so you can browse or add new tasks and reminders for future dates.

We tested the reminder by location by having it tell us ""Don't forget your iPad"" once we left the building here at CNET. Sure enough, the iPhone reminded us once we got about a half block away from the building. You also can have it remind you to do something when you arrive at a location, like ""Call Mom when I get home."" These will both be extremely useful for those of us who don't remember all the details.

Browsing through your reminders is easy with a starting page where you can quickly track and search for reminders using a search field. You also have the option to create tasks for more-open-ended reminders that don't need to be done by a specific time. We think Apple did an admirable job with this app, but we think many of the plethora of to-do apps at the iTunes App Store offer more options. For simple reminders and tasks, however, the Reminders app will probably be enough for most users.

Camera

iOS 5 adds several requested features to the camera app, making it much more like a point-and-shoot camera. You get a shortcut on the lock screen that will launch the camera immediately, even bypassing the lock code. A simple double-tap of the Home button brings up both the basic music controls (as before) and the camera icon in the lower right. You then can use the volume control to snap a photo. The picture is saved to your camera roll, but for security (having not used your access code) you'll only be able to delete the shot (keeping unwanted users from browsing your iPhone photos). Inside the camera you'll get grid lines, pinch to zoom (in addition to a slider bar at the bottom of the screen), autofocus, and the ability to change the exposure.

After taking photos, you can edit your shots with crop, rotate, red-eye reduction, and a single-tap color correction option. The cropping features let you crop your images with a resizable box, or you can constrain the aspect ratio to keep a standard size. Rotate options let you spin an image in 90-degree increments so you won't have to worry about sideways photos. Red-eye reduction is a simple process that has you select the red-eye tool, then tap the red eyes of your subject for instantaneous and impressive results. The single-tap color correction tool balances your colors and, in our tests, did indeed make the image look better. Though we welcome these additions, Apple is way too late to the photo-editing party, as this functionality has existed on basic phones for years. Also, while we like the basic editing features, we doubt it will mean the demise of third-party apps like Photoshop Express.

Mail

The iOS Mail app now has rich text formatting, better indent control, flagging of messages, and the ability to drag addresses between To, CC, and BCC lines. Also, you now can search within the body of a message instead of just in the From, To, and subject lines.

Mail for iOS has needed many of these features for a long time, so it's good that we finally have them. Flagging e-mails as important will certainly help the business crowd. The selection tool (when you double-tap a word and drag selection anchors) is still a little awkward to use--especially for large blocks of text, and it's important to note that you'll need to select text to apply any rich text formatting (bold, italics, or underline options once selected). Still these are needed steps forward for the Mail app, and users will appreciate the changes.

One thing on our wish list for a future iOS release is for Mail to get Safari's Reader feature. With iOS 5 we still stumbled upon the occasional e-mail with its own special formatting that the app didn't adjust to make eyeball-friendly on the smaller screen. Considering how much e-mail reading people do on their iOS devices, this would be a welcome addition.

PC Free and iCloud

Arguably the most notable change, PC Free will bring over-the-air software updates and device activations. So as on Android, Windows Phone 7, and BlackBerry OS 5 devices, you'll no longer have to plug your device into a computer or even own a computer at all. The updates will serve only the changes, so they'll be shorter, and you'll be able to sync, back up, and restore your device using the new iCloud features. You'll also find new features within apps, like wirelessly editing photos, managing e-mail folders, and creating and deleting calenders.

To sync your iOS device to iTunes on your computer, you need only be on the same Wi-Fi network and your device needs to be charging (plugged into a charger). You can then go to Settings > General on your iPhone to select iTunes Wi-Fi Sync. From there you can select Sync Now on your iPhone and your photos, music, and calendars will be backed up in iTunes.

While not pretty or particularly novel (especially with so many other smartphones offering the same features), over-the-air updates might be the most important of all for iOS in this update. We've heard many stories of users complaining about sync times, and not having your phone tethered to your computer for long periods will be appreciated by all. We'll add more details about iCloud as we use explore it further.

Game Center

Additions for gamers in iOS 5 include the addition of profile photos, the ability to compare achievement points, friends of friends lists, recommended friends and games, support for turn-based games, and a way to buy games directly from Game Center.

We like the added personal touch of adding a photograph to our profile in Game Center, but we think people should have more fun options for page customization (it is ""Game"" Center, after all). Game recommendations (based on your current library) seem pretty solid, but we did find a few games in the list we had previously deleted. The ability to buy games from within Game Center makes it a bit more of a destination, but it still seems like the service will still be a behind-the-scenes social connector as it was in iOS 4.

iMessage

Apple takes a shot at BlackBerry with this instant messaging app that will work across all iOS 5 devices. As with BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), you'll be able to exchange unlimited text messages, photos, and videos with your friends, family, and colleagues. Also, your messages won't cost you anything and they won't count against the monthly allotment of messages from your wireless carrier.

Screenshot by Jason Parker/CNET

You'll also get group messaging, an indicator to see if someone is typing to you, delivery and read receipts, secure encryption, and conversation syncing that is pushed to multiple devices. iMessage will work on 3G and Wi-Fi networks.

The updates to the iPhone messaging system are welcome changes, with some of the new features mimicking what third-party paid chat apps in the iTunes App Store already do. We're a little disappointed that the location and contact sharing features don't come straight from iMessage (you need to share them from the Map app or your contacts) as found in third-party apps. Still, the ability to send that data to a friend is an improvement. For example, to send a contact, you'll need to go to your home screen, open your contacts, select a person, choose the Share Contact button, then choose iMessage. It would have been better if we could bring up the contact list straight from iMessage. We will be comparing these features more in depth to BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) later this week.

Find My Friends

Announced at the unveiling of the iPhone 4S, Find My Friends is an iOS 5-exclusive app that lets you view your friends' and family's locations in real time on a map when they agree to share location info with you. For added security, you can set a time limit for how long you share your location, a major concern of people who don't want to continually broadcast their location.

You start by signing in with your iTunes account ID, then you can send an invite to friends using their iTunes account ID. Once received, they will need to send a request to you as well. After everyone has given permission, you'll be able to get a pretty close approximation of where your friends are on a map. In our testing in San Francisco, our location would be very accurate on one street, then in another location it would be a block away from where we were standing. The app seems mostly accurate, but your mileage may vary depending on where you use it.

Find my Friends offers a friend list, so once you have both given permission, you can send a request at a later date to have that person allow his or her location to be shared. The app also has options to give you directions to your friends (via Maps) or speak to them on FaceTime (iPhone 4 or newer) if you can't get an exact location.

While these types of location features might be useful in specific situations, Android has similar services that have received mixed reviews--specifically by those who were worried about security concerns. Still, with the ability to specify a time limit, we think Find My Friends will be useful to many people.

The Find My Friends app went live at the iTunes App Store just before iOS 5's release.

Cards

A new greeting card delivery app also became available in the iTunes App Store alongside the iOS 5 release. Cards lets you design a card on your iOS device and have Apple print it up on high-quality paper (yes, it will be real paper) and send it to your chosen recipient. The service comes with a price, though; you'll pay $2.99 to send a card within the U.S. and $4.99 to send a card anywhere in the world.

Start making a greeting card by touching the Create button. Then, choose from several card exteriors that offer seasonal- or event-appropriate designs. Across the bottom of the interface are icons to narrow your search for travel-related cards, birthday cards, and a few others. Once your exterior is selected, you can snap a new photo with your iPhone camera or add a photo from your iPhone library to personalize the card. Next, you can edit the text inside the card to personalize it for your friend or family member. Finally, you can add the recipient's address to the front of the envelope and your return address. Don't worry too much about making mistakes; you have buttons across the top of screen for each stage of the process: Outside, Inside, and Envelope. When you're finished, you can review your selections then make the purchase using your Apple account.

There are several services (like Postcardly or apps like Real Postcards) that let you send post cards, but Cards in iOS 5 sends fold-open greeting cards on real paper in an envelope via snail mail (all done through Apple), and gives you a push notification when it's been delivered. Though it doesn't have quite the number of customization options that other services have, it's a convenient way to send someone a special treat in the mail.

Siri

A feature exclusive to the iPhone 4S, Siri builds on the iOS Voice Control feature while adding a lot more. Working as an AI voice control system that comprehends what you're saying, Siri lets you give your iPhone commands or ask it questions using natural language. It's more than just a ""Call home"" voice command system; you can simply say, ""Remind me to call my wife at 4:30 about dinner"" and Siri will respond by setting up a time in your calendar and repeating the specifics of the event so you can confirm it for a reminder. You can also tell Siri to read your latest text messages, and you can ask it the fastest way home from your current location and other complex questions. Siri comprehends (most) questions and tries to give you the best answer.

Screenshot by Jason Parker/CNET

Siri offers features that anyone can appreciate who's been driving and heard the iPhone's telltale text notification sound, for example. It also ushers in a new way to interface with iPhones, if Apple can pull it off. Siri is still in beta and will be available to iPhone 4S users at launch on October 14. Expect a deeper dive into Siri once we get our hands on the iPhone 4S.

Personal dictionary

A new keyboard shortcut feature lets you create your own personal dictionary. While nothing new, you'll now be able to set up keyboard shortcuts for phrases. Head to Settings > General > Keyboard, then scroll down to Add New Shortcut. Here you can add a phrase like ""Talk to you later"" then make the shortcut ""ttyl."" Now, every time you type those letters in an e-mail or text, it will be spelled out automatically.

Alternate Routes

Another new feature that travelers will appreciate is Alternate Routes. When in the Map app, you can get directions as usual, but instead of giving you just one route to your destination, the Map app will now give you two alternate routes (in case of problems like traffic or if you know of nearby construction sites). Simply touch a route to find out how long it will take to get to your destination, then choose the best for your situation. In our tests here in San Francisco, the routes were solid options, and we think this will come in handy wherever you are. The noticeable downside here is that once you've picked your route, the other ones remain on screen, which can be distracting.

Plenty more

Other updates include new multitasking gestures for the iPad, hourly weather forecasts, a split keyboard for the iPad, a new iPad music app, an iTunes ringtone store, AirPlay mirroring for the iPad 2 and iPhone 4S, Emoji emoticons, and custom vibration patterns. Check back for more in-depth features about many of these in the coming weeks.

Conclusions

In the end, iOS 5 seems more about fixing a lot of niggling annoyances than offering a completely new phone. And though we'd always love more, that's fine with us. Over-the-air syncing is probably the biggest relief for most iOS device owners, but improvements to iMessage, integrated Twitter features, useful but fairly simple camera upgrades, and the addition of task management and reminders are marked improvements over past versions.

Added extras like a place for magazine and newspaper subscriptions in Newsstand, greeting cards in Cards, and Find My Friends features might be useful in some situations, but we wonder just how important they will be to users over time. Apple has smartly decoupled most of these from the iOS itself, giving those who want a lean and mean device that option from the get go.

Overall, iOS 5 is a worthy upgrade with some huge new features, several useful tweaks, and smaller additions that may not have as big of an impact on how you use your iOS device. As a free upgrade that improves your overall experience, iOS 5 is a no-brainer for any iDevice owner. Even though we like what we see, we hope to see tweaks in future upgrades that refine each of the new features a bit more.",html
http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/the-pay-off-can-you-lose-the-plastic-and-use-only-apple-pay-or-android-pay,The Pay-off: Can you lose the plastic and use only Apple Pay or Android Pay?,"November,Pm,Clifford Col",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"We love the idea of using mobile devices to pay for stuff. For those of us who always have phone in hand, waving it at a payment reader seems more convenient than fishing a debit or credit card out of our wallets.

Apple and Google have been making a big deal about their mobile-payment services this year. So we decided to set up the two companies' mobile payment apps -- Josh with an iPhone 6S and Cliff using a Samsung Galaxy S6 -- and head out to see how far Apple Pay and Android Pay could carry us through a regular week of purchases.

How the payment tech works

Both Apple Pay and Android Pay use NFC, or near-field communication, to talk with a payment reader. As its names suggests, NFC transmits information a very short distance -- five centimeters or so -- to a store's point-of-sale device. You can, of course, also touch your phone to the reader to complete the transaction.

The Apple Pay mobile payment service works with iOS 8.1 and later on the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S, and 6S Plus; the iPad Air 2, Mini 3 and 4, and Pro; and Apple Watch-compatible devices.

Android Pay requires Android 4.4 (KitKat) or later, and your Android device must be able to handle NFC. That shouldn't be too big of a hurdle, as most Android devices released in the past few years come equipped with NFC. The Samsung Galaxy line has included NFC since the S II, for example, and the HTC One phones have offered NFC from the start of the line. (Here's a list of NFC-enabled phones.)

Google just released Android Pay this fall, replacing Google Wallet, which Google is remaking into a Venmo-like app for sending and receiving money from other people.

Setting up Apple Pay and Android Pay

First, we set up the two payment apps by entering credit card information.

Apple Pay

Setting up Apple Pay was ridiculously easy. Josh needed to sign in to his iCloud account and move through a few screens to add a credit card. Apple Pay presented a screen that let him scan his credit card, grabbing the card number and expiration date. It also offered him the choice of entering card details by hand.

Josh entered several cards, and Apple Pay made the first one the default. To change the default, go to Settings, Transaction Defaults, Default Card. Then tap your preferred default card.

Apple Pay suggested Josh's name as it appears on his Apple account instead of how it appears on his credit card account. Be sure to check that Apple Pay is using the name as it appears on your card.

Josh hit one bump when he couldn't get Apple Pay to successfully scan his Virgin America Visa. This card uses a portrait orientation to display information -- unlike most cards, which are landscape -- so we thought that might be confusing Apple Pay. Josh contacted Virgin, which informed him that the Comenity-Capital-Bank-backed card is not part of Apple Pay yet but will be around the start of 2016. Here's a list of banks that work with Apple Pay.

Android Pay

When Cliff opened the Android Pay app, it showed a list of credit cards he'd added to his Google account over the years and asked him to confirm some details. The cards, mostly expired, were tied to the Google Play Store.

Removing expired cards wasn't straightforward. Cliff dug around Android Pay but couldn't find an obvious way. Ultimately, he went to payments.google.com, logged in, and removed the out-of-date cards there. He could, however, remove active cards through Android Pay.

He wanted to add a new card, so he tapped Add Another Card, which took him to a screen where he could capture an image of his card. He could also enter card details manually. After successfully grabbing the image, the app took him to a screen where he could adjust card details. He needed to enter the card security code, for example, and change the card address, as the screen displayed an older address.

After tying the card to the app, Android Pay told Cliff he had to turn on NFC to pay with the device.

Adding another card was easy enough: Cliff tapped the plus sign in the bottom-right corner of the screen and then tapped ""Add a credit or debit card"" to step through the process again.

As with Apple Pay, the first card Cliff added to Android Pay became his default payment card. To change the default card, select the card you want and then tap Set As Default Card. You can also drag the card to the Default Card slot at the top of the screen.

Here's a list of banks that work with Android Pay and which types of transactions they do and don't support.

Security in Apple Pay and Android Pay

No one wants to buy something in a store and then discover that their credit card information has been stolen.

As part of its security, Apple Pay requires your passcode or Touch ID to complete a transaction. Behind the scenes, Apple uses a security mechanism called tokenization, which allows the company to keep sensitive credit card information off your iOS device. With tokenization, the credit card number stays with the financial company, and Apple Pay uses a substitute account number token to represent the real card number.

If you misplace your phone, someone would have to know your passcode to use Apple Pay. And if you have turned on Find My iPhone, you can suspend Apple Pay by placing your iPhone in Lost Mode using Find My iPhone. You can also remove the ability to pay with Apple Pay by erasing the device remotely using Find My iPhone.

Android Pay also requires your phone's passcode or pattern unlocking mechanism to authenticate a payment. If you are running Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) on a phone with a fingerprint sensor, you can use fingerprint authentication to trigger a transaction.

Like Apple, Google uses tokenization for Android Pay and substitutes your credit card details with a virtual account number. And if you lose track of your device, if you have turned on Android Device Manager (ADM), you can lock or erase your Android phone on Google's ADM website.

According to security experts, tokenization raises the bar on securing mobile transactions. ""The security behind Apple Pay and Google Pay is sound,"" says Paul Ferguson, a senior threat research advisor at Trend Micro. ""The technology Apple and Google use and the NFC technologies they are based on are secure.""

Ferguson cautions, however, that users still need to be watchful. ""There is no such thing as 100 percent secure,"" he told us, recommending that users still need build up their mobile security defenses, starting with good password management.

Apple Pay and Android Pay in action

We found that Apple Pay and Android Pay work equally well and are surprisingly easy to use. Tap your phone on an NFC reader, authorize the payment, and you are done. The process is very similar to using a debit or credit card. What is also surprising is that while mobile payment readers aren't scarce, less than a third of the businesses we visited in the Bay Area over a week accepted Apple Pay or Android Pay.

Here's a list of the many local businesses (including several chains) we visited and whether they accepted mobile payments.

Walgreens not only accepts both payment methods but also was able to use Josh's Walgreens mobile rewards card stored in Apple Wallet.

Peet's coffee shop accepts Apple Pay and Android Pay.

Berkeley's Monterey Market takes both Apple and Android Pay, and a store clerk said that both are popular ways to pay.

McDonald's, to Josh's relief, accepts both payment apps.

Radio Shack had one reader and could handle Apple Pay and Android Pay.

Trader Joe's takes both Apple Pay and Android Pay. A checker said, however, few customers take advantage of them.

At the downtown San Francisco Apple Store, Josh bought the new iPad Pro using Apple Pay. To their credit, the store employees didn't laugh when Cliff asked if they accept Android Pay.

T-Mobile accepts Apple Pay, but the clerks said that the store wasn't set up to accept Android Pay yet.

Starbucks does not accept Apple Pay or Android Pay but does accept mobile payments through its Starbucks app, which you can load up via Apple Wallet.

At Solano Cellars, a Berkeley wine shop, a clerk said he had ordered an NFC reader, as many customers ask to pay with their phones.

Costco doesn't take mobile payments, but a checker said she heard her store might start early next year.

Pastime, Cliff's local hardware store, doesn't take mobile payments.

iScream, a Berkeley ice cream shop, doesn't handle either payment method. That didn't diminish how good its ice cream is.

Despite Bank of America being one of the banks that supports mobile payments, the teller at the local branch told Cliff he couldn't use the B of A debit card on his phone to withdraw money from his account.

Harvest & Rowe, a casual restaurant near our office, does not accept mobile payments.

CVS pharmacy doesn't support either mobile payment app.

Target doesn't accept either mobile app either.

The post office doesn't accept either app. But the holiday stamps this year are especially nice.

Chipotle doesn't work for either app. We've been reading about the restaurant's possible adoption of mobile payments for a year, so we were surprised to find out it doesn't yet.

At the Cerrito Theatre, the ticket seller apologized for taking only ""old-school credit cards and cash"" and didn't know of plans to start accepting mobile payments.

The Gap does not accept either app. We heard a nearby Gap was running a mobile payment trial, but when we showed up, the store just accepted cash or credit cards.

Berkeley's beloved Zachary's Chicago Pizza does not handle mobile payments for its stuffed pizza pies.

Neither does Kensington's Benchmark Pizzeria, which makes equally good but much thinner pies.

While we didn't expect the Chai Cart on Market Street to accept either payment app, we were glad we could pay via Square (Android, iOS).

Cliff didn't see an NFC reader at his local Safeway and asked if he could pay with his phone. The clerk thought he was offering to barter his Android device for his bag of groceries.

What's the payout?

We are still in the early days of mobile payments -- Apple Pay arrived a year ago and Android Pay came out this fall. A recent study shows mobile payment usage growing, but the numbers are small. With Apple Pay, for example, just 16.6 percent of iPhone 6 users have tried the payment app. Another study shows Android Pay usage is even less, at least on supported Samsung devices.

Apple Pay and Android Pay are each a snap to use. There just aren't enough places to use them. For a while at least, we will still need to carry our cards.

Opera announced last week that it would launch two new mobile browsers at CTIA--Opera Mobile 11 and Opera Mini 6--but when it came to new and enhanced features, it mostly kept quiet.

We were lucky enough to get our hands on a preview build before the show, and can share a lot more about what's in store for Opera on mobile phones and tablets.

Photograph by Jessica Dolcourt/CNET

Starting with the interface, the Opera browser gets a little bump in sophistication on an already graphically rich display. Opera loyalists will note some subtle changes--Opera has shaved off the title bar to give its browser more room, the Settings icon has changed into the Opera ""O"" icon, and the search engine selector has further retreated within the search field.

A sharing menu shortcut is a new feature to hit the browser duo. Pressing the ""O"" icon pulls up the options screen. In addition to bookmarks, history, settings, downloads, and so on is the option to share via e-mail, text, Twitter, Facebook, and other social networks.

You also get pinch-to-zoom across the board on all compatible devices supported by both browser versions. Before, you sometimes had to tap to zoom in. Opera says it has also enhanced the scrolling, panning, and zooming.

Opera is also jumping on the tablet craze by optimizing Mini and Mobile for the larger tablet screens. On the Motorola Xoom (running Android 3.0 Honeycomb) that we loaded it on, Opera Mobile looks almost the same as it does on an Android smartphone, except that the navigation bar moves to the top.

Overall, Opera worked quickly and smoothly, with just two exceptions. Opera had no problem loading Web sites, but we found one (Chow.com) whose loading width must have confused the browser because the image rhythmically shrank back, then expanded until we tapped it. (Chow.com is a part of CBS Interactive, which also publishes CNET.) Another outlier issue is that Opera Mobile did not properly load a Web page we needed to authenticate CNET's public Wi-Fi. We had to open the default browser before we could use Opera. This has been a challenge for Opera for years, and one gap in its service that, while it won't affect most people, demonstrates a weakness that a browser of this caliber should have long overcome.

Opera Mini 6--the more condensed, speedier, proxy version--will be available on Android, BlackBerry, Symbian/Series 60, and Java (J2ME) phones. Opera Mobile 11--the native, standalone browser--will be compatible with Android, Symbian, Windows 7 (think tablets), and MeeGo.

You can download either of the free browsers in your device's app store (this may not be true for all) or by pointing the browser to m.opera.com. Then, let us know what you think about the new Opera Mini and Opera Mobile.

http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10228665-2.html,Mozilla releases Firefox 3.5 beta,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Mozilla on Monday released beta 3.5 of Firefox, a revamp of the open-source Web browser designed to include better performance, several new Web programming features, and a private browsing mode.

The earlier betas had been numbered 3.1, but Mozilla switched to the version 3.5 name after concluding the changes were more significant than it envisioned earlier. Mozilla has said earlier the fourth beta will the last, with more polished release candidates expected before the final version of Firefox 3.5 is released. You can download Firefox 3.5 beta 4 from CNET Download.com for Windows and Mac.

The software emerges amid what's become a fiercely competitive browser market. Microsoft has released a significant new version, Internet Explorer 8, while Google has entered the market with Chrome and Apple is trying to secure a Windows foothold for its Safari browser. Firefox holds second place in market share to IE.

Among the changes compared with the current Firefox 3.0.x versions are the faster TraceMonkey engine for running Web sites' JavaScript programs; built-in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) technology for exchanging data between servers and browsers; support for tags to describe audio and video content the way images have been available for years; the private browsing mode for leaving no traces on your computer while surfing; support for technology to let permitted applications know the user's location; and support for the Web workers standard for letting a browser perform processing in the background without holding back a Web application's user interface.

There are a number of known problems with Gmail and with AVG SafeSearch v8.0 on Windows, and as usual, many of those extensions that are so popular on Firefox could break. For details, check the release notes.",html

But among the feature announcements and hardware teaser images, Jobs also announced the availability of some new apps that will take advantage of the new hardware.

Screenshot by Jason Parker/CNET

Netflix for iPhone was a welcome announcement, with the iPad version of the app already popular with its streaming ""Watch Instantly"" capabilities. According to Apple, now you'll be able to start a movie on your iPad or iPhone and then continue watching on another device or your desktop computer. Though it's great you'll be able to watch Netflix movies anywhere, we wonder just how popular watching movies on the 3.5-inch screen will be.

Screenshot by Jason Parker/CNET

Popular online game developer Zynga also got in on the act, announcing the availability of ""Farming,"" an iPhone app version of the insanely popular Facebook game FarmVille. With more than 70 million people playing FarmVille, bringing the game to the iPhone is pretty much a sure hit. We have to admit, though: we worry about the already over-stressed FarmVille harvesters now that their farms will be accessible anywhere.

Activision came to the stage next announcing the launch of Guitar Hero ($2.99) for iPhone and iPod Touch (announced as available today, but it's not in the App Store yet--we'll add a link when it becomes available). Though Guitar Hero has already enjoyed huge success on consoles, we'll be interested to see how much traction this app will gain on the iPhone/iPod platform. Will the 3.5-inch touch screen be enough for Guitar Hero fans without the advantage of holding the instruments in your hands? We'll soon find out.

Screenshot by Jason Parker/CNET

The announcements were not limited to third-party developers, though. Apple also announced the launch of iMovie for iPhone 4 ($4.99). In the brief demo, Apple showed how you can edit movies using the touch-screen interface. Like the iMovie software for Mac, your timeline resides at the bottom of the screen with the footage taking up the top three-quarters of the screen. You'll be able to use iMovie in both portrait and landscape views; pinch to zoom will be available; and you'll be able to change the scale of your movie's timeline, and touch and drag to trim. Adding photos will automatically get the slow pan/zoom of the Ken Burns Effect. You will also be able to add theme transitions and titles, record geolocation (automatically inserted into theme), add music from iTunes, and much more. When you're finished, you'll be able to export to three different resolutions including 360p and 540p to conserve on storage space, or 720p for HD quality video.

That was all that was shown regarding new apps at the WWDC keynote, but we expect that many more apps that take advantage of the iPhone 4 hardware will be revealed in the coming weeks. We're especially excited to see how developers will use the iPhone 4's new gyroscope features, along with all the other new additions to iOS 4.",html

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Called the Griffin project, the HTML and JavaScript-based API system will display apps from within the uTorrent interface in an embedded browser window. The developer SDK has yet to be released, and there was no indication which browser engine was being used at the time of writing. Currently, four demo apps are available.

There's a VirusGuard provided by security vendor BitDefender; a list of the top free games at Raptr that includes download links, file size, and genre; and VODO, which is like Raptr but for legally free independent movies. There's also ?Gadget, which adds an Ask.com-powered toolbar to Internet Explorer and Firefox and gives users uTorrent features. uTorrent has long had a relationship with Ask.com, where the program has often opted users in to installing the Ask.com toolbar unless they actively opted out, so it's not surprising that Ask.com shows up in the only ""monetizing"" demo app.

During casual testing, the apps appeared not to affect torrenting or other program behavior adversely.

For readers who've noticed that the screenshots and download of the alpha say ""beta"" on them, it's apparently because of an internal uTorrent naming convention that forces all releases to be marked as beta--even the alphas.

http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/organize-your-images-with-apple-photos/,Organize your images with Apple Photos,"March,Pm,Clifford Col",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Taking photos with your iPhone is a snap. Finding the photos later on your Mac can be more work. But Apple's Photos for OS X offers a variety of ways to quickly hunt down and manage your photos.

Automatically organized

Photos for OS X automatically sorts your photographs by date and location. The first set is called Moments, such as photos from an afternoon ball game. Moments become part of Collections -- games you attended over a month, for example. And Collections roll up into Years.

By clicking the back and forth buttons on the left side of the toolbar, you can navigate through the photo groups.

If you click a Moments, Collections, or Years label, you can view a map for those photos that includes geotag information.

The sidebar

The sidebar gives you quick access to your photos. To view the sidebar, choose View, then Show Sidebar, or press Command-Option-S.

For those who miss iPhoto, the sidebar should look familiar: You can easily look through and organize your photos by dragging them into and out of folders. You can drag photos into albums or tap the + button in the toolbar to add them to a new or existing album.

Smart Albums

Along with the the regular folders you can drag image into and out of, you can create Smart Albums, which automatically gather photos based on rules you set. Click + in the toolbar and choose Smart Album, and set the rules for the folder. You can also tweak the rules by selecting the Smart Album and then choosing File and Edit Smart Album.

Favorites and keywords

When you find an image with special meaning, click the heart in the top-left of a photo thumbnail to make it a favorite and add it to the Favorites folder in the sidebar. You can also favorite a photo by double-clicking its thumbnail and then clicking the heart button in the toolbar. For images that span folders but share a common theme -- photos with flowers in them, for example -- you can tag them by adding keywords in their Info window (Command-+). Then search for keywords to bring up all images tagged with the same label.

Places and faces

If your photos contain GPS information, Photos for OS X can display them on a map. To add location information to photos without GPS tags, open the Info window for a photo, tap in the Assign a Location area at the bottom of that window, and enter the location of the photo. Then, to pinpoint the exact location of the snapshot, Command-click the pushpin and drag it to an area on the map.

The first time you open Photos, it scans your photos for faces. You can can open the Faces album in the sidebar and start assigning names to faces and confirm proposed matches.

For those who used iPhoto, Photos for OS X should feel both familiar and snappier and offer sensible ways of finding photos. If you are coming from the iOS version of the app, the learning path should be short, as the two apps look and behavior in a similar way.",html

James Martin/CNET

SAN FRANCISCO--On Monday morning Steve Jobs will take the stage at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference at Moscone West here. In all likelihood, he will be introducing the next version of the iPhone. And we will be there to bring you live coverage of the event.

Jobs' keynote will start at 10 a.m. PDT Monday. I'll be live blogging all the news from his speech, along with CNET's iPhone reviewer Kent German and CNET News' Josh Lowensohn. For a reminder of when the event will start, sign up below. You can also bookmark this page and come back here Monday morning.

Though the iPhone is widely expected to be the star of the show, expect more details about iPhone OS 4, the iPad, and lots about apps. The theme of this year's conference is, after all, ""The Center of the App Universe.""

Jason Howell, Rafe Needleman, Donald Bell, and Brian Cooley will be doing a special edition of Buzz Out Loud while the event is running. There's an embed of that video podcast at the bottom of this page, in case you want to listen to their commentary while following along with the Cover It Live live blog. Also, check out the official WWDC 2010 Bingo card and photos of workers setting up for the event on Friday.

9:51 a.m. PDT: Welcome to our WWDC 2010 live blog. I'm here with CNET's Kent German inside Moscone West where we're listening to Louis Armstrong while waiting for the event to begin. Josh Lowensohn will also be on hand to help out answering your questions once the event gets going. It'll probably kick off in about 10 minutes.

9:55 a.m. (Josh Lowensohn): We're getting a lot of questions about a live video feed. Apple does not allow such things, which is why you don't see one from us, or anyone else. We will be bringing you the news and photos of the keynote as it happens, as well as video highlights immediately afterwards. Apple typically posts a full stream of the keynote a day later.

9:57 a.m.: OK, they tell us we're about to get started momentarily.

9:58 a.m. (Josh Lowensohn): Besides our coverage here, CNET's Buzz Out Loud is doing live, real-time (same thing I guess) podcast coverage of the keynote, which you can watch/listen to here.

10:02 a.m.: Lots of Louis Armstrong while we wait.

10:01 a.m.: OK, lights are going down. Music is fading out. Here we go.

Steve Jobs takes the stage. Standing ovation from the WWDC crowd.

James Martin/CNET

10:02 a.m. (Kent German): Funny to see media people shooting photos of Jobs with an Android phone.

10:02 a.m.: He says it's great to be here. The conference has 5,200 attendees from 57 countries this year.

10:03 a.m.: He's going to start with some iPad updates first.

10:04 a.m.: Apple has sold more than 2 million iPads, as we know, in 59 days. It's in 10 countries total. Now he's going to show a quick video about it.

James Martin/CNET

10:06 a.m.: The iPad will be in 19 countries by the end of July, he says. There are 8,500 iPad apps, plus 200,000 iPhone apps that also work on it. That's 17 apps per iPad that have been downloaded, according to Jobs.

10:08 a.m.: Now he's running through some apps: Financial Times, a DJ app, Elements (the Periodic Table), and others. He says the Elements people earned more on the sales on the iPad in one day than five years of Google ads on the company's same site.

James Martin/CNET

10:09 a.m.: Now he's talking about iBooks. In 65 days, users have downloaded 5 million books. About 2.5 books per iPad. ""That's terrific,"" he says.

The share of e-books going through the iBooks store is 22 percent in 8 weeks, according the publishers on the iBooks store. Some enhancements from iBooks: You can now make notes.

10:10 a.m.: There's a new control where you can tap to bookmark the page. On the table of contents you'll see all your bookmarks and notes too.

One of the biggest requests was the ability to view and read PDFs. That's now built in, he says.

10:11 a.m.: You can select between books or PDFs within your iBooks shelves. That will be out a little bit later this month.

James Martin/CNET

10:11 a.m.: I'd like to talk about the App Store, he says. ""I want to make something really clear. We support two platforms at Apple."" The first one is HTML5, a fully open and uncontrolled platform, he says.

James Martin/CNET

10:12 a.m.: We fully support that. Apple's browsers are in the lead in terms of supporting the HTML5 standard. Anyone can write HTML5 apps and have them on iPhone, Mac, iPod, iPod Touch, iPad.

The second platform we support is the App Store.

10:13 a.m.: There are 225,000 apps there. Now I'd like to talk about that. You've read a lot about our process of approving apps. We get 15,000 apps sumbitted every week. And they come in in up to 30 different languages. ""Guess what? 95 percent are approved within seven days.""

James Martin/CNET

10:14 a.m.: Why don't we approve the other 5 percent? The No. 1 reason? An app doesn't do what the developer says it does. The second reason is use of private APIs. We're clear on this.

Developers who do that know what they're doing, but they can't. Third reason we reject apps? They crash. ""If you were in our shoes, you'd reject those app for the same reason. Just wanted to give you those facts.""

10:15 a.m. (Kent German): Interesting that Jobs is addressing the app approval process so thoroughly. We heard the 95 percent number twice.

10:16 a.m.: Now, I'd like to highlight eBay, he says. Was on iPhone last year. It was downloaded 10 million times. Will apps all be that successful, he says? He's going to show us three new entertainment-oriented apps. First up is Netflix. Reed Hastings is up on stage to talk about it.

10:16 a.m.: Hastings says the iPad app has gone really well. 2,000 downloads, he says. But now, Netflix will be on the iPhone this summer, for free.

10:17 a.m.: They're demo-ing it now. Same service you get on your TV or laptop or iPad. Can start a movie on your TV and pick it up on your iPhone. Also will get your recommendations, your viewing history, and the entire catalog and your queue.

James Martin/CNET

10:18 a.m.: You can add movies to your queue right from the phone. It is using the HTTP adaptive bit rate playback technology over Wi-Fi or 3G. That's it from Netflix. Next up is Zynga, the social games company.

10:19 a.m.: Mark Pincus, Zynga's CEO takes the stage.

10:19 a.m. (Kent German): Hoping the app parade is short and we get on to the big news soon!

10:19 a.m.: ""Farming"" for the iPhone is what he'll be introducing. It's FarmVille for the iPhone.

James Martin/CNET

10:20 a.m.: It has 70 million monthly active users, he says. Now they're demo-ing the game. The same farm you can build on Facebook can also be accessed on the iPhone.

10:21 a.m.: You can buy a snow leopard on the iPhone version only, Zynga says. Cute.

10:23 a.m. (Kent German): Hmmm. Not sure that more Farmville notifications are what we need.

10:23 a.m.: It will be available by the end of June.

10:23 a.m.: Next (and last, we think) is Activision. They're going to talk about Guitar Hero.

10:24 a.m.: Karthik Bala, SVP at Activision, says there's a new iPhone and iPod Touch version of Guitar Hero. He's showing a demo of how the app will work.

James Martin/CNET

10:26 a.m.: You can download new songs to play right over the iPhone, Bala says. He's also giving us a nice air guitar demonstration.

10:26 a.m. (Kent German): Wow. The music got MUCH louder during this demo.

James Martin/CNET

10:26 a.m.: The new version of the app is on sale today for $2.99. And they're off. Steve is back.

10:27 a.m.: He says last week they crossed 5 billion downloads from the App Store. His favorite stat, he says, is coming up. 70 percent of app sales goes to developers. To date, Apple has paid $1 billion to developers.

James Martin/CNET

10:28 a.m.: There's a lot of cheering for that, naturally.

10:28 a.m.: Now, he says, he's going to talk about the iPhone.

10:29 a.m.: ""There have been a lot of stats floating around about it. Some of them are OK. Some of them are questionable, you can make your own judgments about market share."" For Q1 of 2010, Nielsen says RIM is No. 1 with 35 percent. iPhone is No. 2 with 28 percent. Windows Mobile with 19 percent. Android is 4th place with 9 percent.

James Martin/CNET

10:30 a.m.: Mobile browser usage in the U.S.: iPhone has 58.2 percent. That's 2.5 times as much as Android's 12.7 percent. ""This may help you put things in perspective,"" he says, to some laughs.

James Martin/CNET

""It's hard to remember what it was like before iPhone,"" he says. Apps weren't the same. There was no free market for apps. iPhone changed that in 2007, he says.

10:31 a.m. (Kent German): The main event!

10:31 a.m.: IN 2008, we added 3G networking. 2009 we made the phone twice as fast. For 2010 we'll take biggest leap since the original iPhone.

We're introducing iPhone 4. ""This is really hot,"" he says.

10:32 a.m.: There are 100 new features, but he's going to cover 8 of them. First, all new design. ""Some of you have already seen this,"" he says. To great applause.

10:32 a.m. (Kent German): So not quite the iPhone 4G, but definitely not the iPhone HD.

10:32 a.m.: ""Believe me, you ain't seen this. You gotta see it in person.""

10:32 a.m. (Kent German): As expected, a mention of the lost iPhone saga.

10:32 a.m.: It's the most precise thing we've ever made. Glass on front, and back. Stainless steel around. Its closest kin is a beautiful old Leica camera.

10:33 a.m.: ""It's really thin,"" he says, but doesn't specify how thin.

10:33 a.m. (Kent German): From the front it looks about the same, but the profile is different.

10:33 a.m.: OK, now he does: 9.3 mm thick. A quarter thinner than iPhone 3GS. Thinnest smartphone yet, he says.

James Martin/CNET

10:34 a.m. (Kent German): Thinnest on the planet, but for how long? That race changes daily.

10:34 a.m.: There's a front-facing camera, a receiver, a microSIM tray, a camera with LED flash in the back. On bottom, a mic, 30-pin connector, and speaker. On top, a second mic, second sleep/wake button, and noise-cancellation button.

10:34 a.m.: People have wanted to know what the seam in the side of the phone is about, he says.

10:35 a.m.: It turns out there are three lines in the stainless steel structure of the phone. The slits in it are part of the engineering. It uses the stainless steel band as part of the antenna system.

James Martin/CNET

10:35 a.m. (Kent German): Why is Apple pushing the micro-SIM format? Will be able to move the same SIM card between an iPhone and iPad? Or is it just to save plastic?

10:35 a.m.: Integrated antennae right in the structure of the phone. ""Really cool engineering"" he says.

10:35 a.m.: The glass is for better optical quality and scratch resistance, he says.

James Martin/CNET

James Martin/CNET

10:36 a.m.: Second new thing: A retina display. ""What's that?"" In any display there are pixels. With retina display we dramatically increase the pixel density. Four times as many in the same amount of space.

10:37 a.m.: More precision in display with more pixels. ""We get really, really sharp text,"" he says.

10:37 a.m.: 326 pixels per inch.

10:37 a.m.: The crowd is impressed, lots of cheers.

10:37 a.m. (Kent German): Jobs pushed the antenna and its benefits. His first indirect nod to call quality that I remember seeing.

10:38 a.m.: 300 pixels per inch is the limit of the human retina, he says. So things start to look like continuous curves at that level. Text will look like a printed book, he says. We are comfortably over that limit. He shows us two side by side.

10:39 a.m.: ""Once you use a retina display you can't go back,"" he says. With character-based languages it's ""striking"" and with pictures and video, the same effect, he says.

10:40 a.m.: He's now going to compare the iPhone 3GS' display versus the iPhone 4 for us.

James Martin/CNET

James Martin/CNET

10:40 a.m.: ""We had to get special projectors for this,"" he says.

10:41 a.m.: Now he's showing us The New York Times, though the connection is hanging a bit. ""The networks are always kind of unpredictable in here. If you're on Wi-Fi, if you could just get off, I'd appreciate it,"" he says.

10:42 a.m.: ""I don't know what's wrong with our networks,"" Jobs says. He's silent for a bit. But now he's going to try some back ups, he tells us.

10:42 a.m. (Josh Lowensohn): @Jobs, we're on Sprint :)

10:42 a.m.: His phone says ""Cannot activate cellular networks,"" to some laughs from the crowd. ""Well geez. I guess I can't show you that much today. I can show you some pictures.""

10:44 a.m.: He shows us the difference in picture quality. He's trying the phone demo again. ""I'm sorry guys, I don't know what's going on."" ""Got any suggestions?"" he asks. Someone shouts ""Verizon."" Jobs says, ""We're actually on Wi-Fi here.""

10:44 a.m. (Josh Lowensohn): Now your photos come with more wrinkles.

10:44 a.m. (Kent German): With the connection issue I wouldn't want to be the AT&T rep in the crowd.

10:45 a.m.: Now he's doing specs. 3.5 inch display. Same IPS (in-plane switching) display as iPad. ""better than OLED,"" he says. Contrast ratio is 800 to 1. iPhone OS 4 makes it so your apps automatically run on the retina display, full size, he says.

James Martin/CNET

10:46 a.m.: Apps will look better without you doing any work, he says. But you can help by putting in higher-resolution artwork.

10:46 a.m.: ""We think this will set the standard for displays for the next several years.""

10:46 a.m. (Kent German): Apple is always good at giving us something we didn't know we wanted. I never had a complaint about the current iPhone display resolution, but the new one looks great.

10:47 a.m.: Display is the most important component of the entire phone, he says.

10:47 a.m.: The iPhone is powered by the A4 chip, designed in-house.

James Martin/CNET

James Martin/CNET

James Martin/CNET

10:48 a.m.: The iPhone 4 is packed to the gills on the inside, he says. He points out they used a micro SIM because it's smaller and they needed the space. The biggest thing in there is the battery. Now it's a little bit bigger.

10:48 a.m.: Since battery is bigger and A4 is good at power management. There is 7 hours of talk time now. 6 hours of 3G browsing, 10 hours of Wi-Fi browsing, and 300 hours of standby.

(Josh Lowensohn): That battery boost will give users an extra 2 hours of 3G talk time over what the 3GS can do.

10:49 a.m.: Environmental report card: arsenic-, mercury-, BFR-free, he says.

James Martin/CNET

10:49 a.m.: Up to 32 GB of storage. Quadband HSDPA/HSUPA.

10:50 a.m.: Another new piece of hardware. We're taking it further, we're adding a gyroscope, he says. Lots of applause.

10:50 a.m.: A three-axis gyro with pitch, roll, and yaw. It's tied with accelerometer to provide six-axis motion sensing. New CoreMotion APIs for extremely precise positioning.

James Martin/CNET

10:51 a.m.: Now he's going to demonstrate this. ""Since this does not require the network I should be OK,"" he jokes.

10:51 a.m.: He's tilting the phone forward back and side to side and the game on screen corresponds. He rotates in a circle and the game rotates too.

James Martin/CNET

10:53 a.m.: ""I can't wait to see what you guys are going to do"" with the gyro, he says to the developers.

10:53 a.m.: These phones are getting more and more intelligent, he says.

10:53 a.m.: Next up: the new camera.

James Martin/CNET

10:54 a.m.: Everybody loves to talk about megapixels with photography. But we ask, how do you make better pictures? They're different things. But cell phone cameras are about capturing photons.

10:54 a.m.: We've gone from a 3-megapixel to 5-MP sensor, but we're using something that's new to smartphones, a back-side illuminated sensor.

10:55 a.m.: Gets the wiring out of the way. We've gone from 3 to 5 MP but kept pixels the same size, 1.75 microns.

10:55 a.m.: There's a 5X digital zoom, tap to focus, and LED flash built in.

10:55 a.m.: He shows us some photos taken from the iPhone 4.

James Martin/CNET

James Martin/CNET

10:56 a.m.: Camera also does HD video recording, he says.

10:56 a.m.: Lots of applause for that. 720p at 30 frames per second.

10:57 a.m.: There's also tap to focus for video. Can edit videos right on phone. Also has 1-click sharing and the LED flash will stay on for the HD video recording.

10:57 a.m.: We're going even further than that, he says. We've written iMovie for iPhone.

James Martin/CNET

10:58 a.m.: He's bringing up Randy Ubillos, the chief architect for Apple's video apps, on stage to demonstrate it.

10:58 a.m.: He runs over the same things Jobs just told us. But now he's demoing it.

10:59 a.m.: Can use the app in portrait or landscape. You can record directly into a video timeline within the app. Can pinch to change the scale of the timeline. Or drag to trim/edit.

11:00 a.m.: Can pan/zoom, add effects, transitions, themes.

James Martin/CNET

James Martin/CNET

11:01 a.m. (Josh Lowensohn): CNET's Tom Krazit notes ""It's rare for Apple to bring product-level executives on stage. They usually reserve that for just senior VP level people like Scott Forstall.""

11:01 a.m.: The camera will bring in geolocation information, too, to the video.

11:01 a.m. (Kent German): Welcome the camera improvements. It's never been bad, but it could stand more features like these.

11:02 a.m.: He demos how you can add map info based on the location, along with photos, music, etc.

James Martin/CNET

11:03 a.m.: OK, Steve is back on stage. You can buy iMovie for $4.99, ""if we approve it,"" he jokes.

James Martin/CNET

11:05 a.m.: He says he figured out why the demo crashed. There are 570 Wi-Fi connections in this room. Either turn off Wi-Fi or I give up. Would you like to see the demos? he asks. All you bloggers need to turn off your notebook Wi-Fis.

11:06 a.m.: OK, now onto iPhone OS 4.

11:07 a.m.: ""We're renaming the OS. Now it's just iOS 4."" Because it's on the iPad, iPod Touch, and iPhone.

James Martin/CNET

11:08 a.m.: He's talking about the features, which we saw in April at the iPhone OS 4 event. Multitasking is something that took us a while to get. He quotes Larry Page from a few weeks ago about sofware running in the background running down the battery.

11:08 a.m.: ""Yes, it does,"" Jobs says. ""Unless you do it right.""

11:09 a.m.: Now he's going to demo Pandora, playing us some Jack Johnson. He's checking e-mail while listening to music. Now he's launching a Web page (big applause that the Wi-Fi here works) simultaneously.

11:09 a.m. (Kent German): Steve's message about multitasking is similar to what he's said before about other features like cut, copy, and paste. They may not be first, but they get it just right.

11:10 a.m.: He shows us some mail features, with the unified in-box. Shows e-mail threading so you can see a whole e-mail conversation.

11:11 a.m.: Now he's going to create a folder to manage apps. By holding and dragging you can drag one app on another and a folder is automatically created. You can rename the folder and add more apps there whenever you want.

11:12 a.m. (Kent German): Multitasking, unified e-mail box and app folders were my most wanted features from the new OS. I liked the demo before and it looks good here, as well.

11:13 a.m.: He's talking enterprise integration now. Data protection, device management, wireless app distribution, deeper VPN support, Exchange Server 2010.

11:13 a.m.: On consumer side, we're adding Bing to the iPhone for search.

11:14 a.m.: Google will be the default, but now you'll have choice of Google, Yahoo, or Bing. Each has a different approach and how they format results, he says. ""Micorsoft's done a really nice job on this, it has HTML5 presentation.""

11:14 a.m.: Developers will get a Golden Master Candidate release of iOS4 today.

11:14 a.m. (Kent German): Interesting that Google is staying as the default search. Leading up to today we had heard rumors to the contrary.

11:15 a.m.: Another major milestone for iOS coming this month. ""We will sell our 100 millionth iOS device,"" he says. That includes iPhones, iPod Touches, and iPads. ""There is definitely a market for your applications.""

11:16 a.m.: Back to iBooks. It's now coming to the iPhone. Same controls, highlighting, notes, and bookmarking. Same bookshelf as on the iPad, same ability to read a PDF.

11:17 a.m.: The iBooks Store is also available right on the iPhone and iPod Touch now too. You can download and purchase a book to iPhone, iPod, or iPad wirelessly. You can download the same book to all your devices at no extra charge.

11:17 a.m.: In addition, iBooks will automatically and wirelessly sync your current place, bookmarks, and notes across all your devices.

11:18 a.m.: So you can start it on your iPad, pick up on your iPhone, if you want.

James Martin/CNET

11:18 a.m.: Now he's demonstrating what iBooks looks like on the retina display.

11:20 a.m.: Now he's showing the library, and opening a PDF. You tap to flip pages through a PDF, and can pinch and zoom as with other apps.

James Martin/CNET

11:21 a.m.: There are 150 million accounts hooked up to the App Store, iTunes, and iBookstore. Most of any store on the Web, he says. ""So people are ready to buy your apps.""

11:21 a.m.: Now he's talking about iAds. Why are we doing this? To help our developers earn money to continue to create free and low-cost apps for users.

11:22 a.m.: He shows banners popping into The Wall Street Journal app. ""We're trying to combine the emotion of video with the interactivity of the Web.""

11:23 a.m.: iAds keep you in your app. The worst thing is to tap on a banner and be taken to some random Web site and somehow get back to where you left off before. If people don't click on ads, you don't make any money. iAds won't hijack users out of the app they're using.

11:23 a.m.: Apple sells and hosts the ads, so developers just have to tell them where to put the ads. And devs get paid 60 percent of the revenue.

11:25 a.m.: Apple started selling ads eight weeks ago. He's listing the companies: Nissan, Citi, Unilever, AT&T, Chanel, GE, Liberty Mutual, State Farm, Geico, Campbell's, Sears, JCPenney, Target, Best Buy, DirecTV, TBS Network, Disney.

11:25 a.m. (Kent German): iAds is a benefit to developers, but I don't see it as as a boon for users. But then again, this is a developers conference.

11:26 a.m.: These are ""high-end brands,"" he emphasizes to developers. Nissan will advertise the electric Leaf car, for example. Jobs is showing what Nissan's Leaf ad will look like. Tapping on the ad makes the ad go full screen. If you want to go back to app, just click and you're back.

11:27 a.m.: He's showing how interactive Nissan's ad is. You can tap to find out the MPG of the car, for example.

James Martin/CNET

11:29 a.m.: iAds will start July 1 for all iOS 4 devices.

11:30 a.m.: Advertisers have committed $60 million so far this year. That's about 48 percent of the entire expected U.S. mobile display advertising market, as predicted by JP Morgan. ""We think we're off to a pretty great start,"" Jobs says.

11:31 a.m.: ""Our goal is to help you earn money,"" he reiterates.

11:31 a.m. (Josh Lowensohn): CNET's Ina Fried points out that Microsoft's Bing will also be a search option in the Mac and Windows version of Safari.

11:31 a.m.: He asks what people think of the iPhone so far. He gets a big cheer.

11:31 a.m.: One more thing, he says.

11:32 a.m.: In 2007 when iPhone launched, he made the first public call onstage, he recalls. Now he's going to do the same today. He's calling Jonathan Ive, Apple's head designer.

11:33 a.m.: He's using the front-facing camera to make a video call. Jonny answers, big applause from the crowd.

11:33 a.m. (Kent German): If iAds is out July 1, will iOS 4 be out to users the same day or before?

11:34 a.m.: They're chatting about the technology in the phone and make a lunch date.

James Martin/CNET

James Martin/CNET

11:35 a.m.: The feature they just used is called ""FaceTime"" video calling. It works between iPhone 4 devices. No set-up required. Works anywhere there is Wi-Fi.

11:36 a.m.: Can make FaceTime calls in landscape or portrait.

11:36 a.m.: It's Wi-Fi only in 2010. We need to work a little bit with our providers. And Apple will ship tens of millions of FaceTime devices this year, he promises.

11:37 a.m.: He's showing a video of how people can use the FaceTime feature.

11:38 a.m. (Kent German): Good to hear FaceTime runs only over Wi-Fi for now. Definitely the best thing for users. Though I'm wondering what the next year could bring in cellular provider news. More U.S. carriers? A real 4G iPhone?

11:39 a.m.: FaceTime is based on a bunch of open standards, which he lists. We're going to standards bodies tomorrow and we're going to make FaceTime and open industry standard.

11:40 a.m.: That's the iPhone 4. It's the biggest leap we've taken since the original iPhone. Price and availability is up next.

11:40 a.m.: It comes in two colors: black and white.

11:41 a.m. (Kent German): Yay! The really good stuff. Price and release date!

11:41 a.m.: It's $199 for 16GB, same as 3GS. $299 for 32GB model. AT&T is going to make a ""an incredibly generous upgrade offer."" If your contract expires anytime during 2010, you can get the new iPhone 4 if you re-sign a new contract.

11:41 a.m.: ""We're thrilled about that.""

11:41 a.m. (Josh Lowensohn): Hmm, no 64GB model. That's a bummer.

11:42 a.m.: 3GS is $99 now, as suspected.

James Martin/CNET

11:42 a.m.: On sale June 24.

11:42 a.m.: Preorders begin June 15. Will ship in U.S. and four other countries on the first day.

11:43 a.m.: By September it will ship in 88 countries. ""Our fastest roll-out ever.""

James Martin/CNET

11:43 a.m. (Kent German): Decent pricing and upgrade offer by AT&T. Hopefully no additional upgrade fees if you move up from a device other than an iPhone.

11:44 a.m.: Time to talk accessories: $29 dock. Also, they've make their own iPhone case. Called a ""bumper"" so it covers the sides of the phone in multiple colors for $29.

11:44 a.m.: iPhone 3GS and iPhone 3G can upgrade iOS 4, though not all features will be supported.

11:44 a.m.: Same goes for iPod Touch, except for first generation.

11:44 a.m.: Upgrade for those devices will be free on June 21.

11:45 a.m.: That's new; iPod Touch users usually pay a small fee.

11:46 a.m.: Now we're getting another video demo, this time about the iPhone 4. They're running through all the features we've heard about so far today.

11:47 a.m. (Kent German): Remember that multitasking will not be avaialble on the iPhone 3G. It will get most other iOS 4 features, though. The 3GS will get multitasking.

James Martin/CNET

11:47 a.m. (Josh Lowensohn): CNET's Maggie Reardon says: ""Cisco has agreed to license the iOS trademark to Apple for use as the name of Apple's operating system for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad. The license is for use of the trademark only and not for any technology.""

11:51 a.m.: OK, video's over and Steve is back.

11:52 a.m.: He's talking again about Apple being at the intersection of technology and liberal arts. He discussed it at the iPad introduction back in January.

James Martin/CNET

11:52 a.m.: He says an example is the front-facing camera in addition to 18 months work on software that ""you'll never even notice"" when placing a video call.

11:53 a.m.: He's thanking all the teams at Apple who've worked their tails off. He asks Mark Papermaster and his hardware team to stand up and get acknowledged by the crowd, which obliges with applause.

11:54 a.m.: The design team, and the A4 chip team take turns too, as does Scott Forstall and the iOS software team.

11:54 a.m.: He also recognizes the operations team headed by Tim Cook, and the ""rest of the Apple family."" ""I'm really proud of all you guys. Awesome job,"" he says.

11:54 a.m. (Kent German): No news about tethering even though AT&T's recent data plan changes mention the feature. Since the iPhone has always been capable, and AT&T was the holdup (iPhone carriers in other countries offer tethering), perhaps that's an AT&T-only announcement.

11:55 a.m.: ""This is our new baby. I hope you love it as much as we do,"" Steve says.

11:55 a.m.: And that's a wrap. He exits the stage.

11:55 a.m. (Kent German): And the wait for the elusive Verizon iPhone continues.

11:56 a.m.: That's it for us too. Thank you everyone that joined us today for our live blog! We'll be digesting all of this new information and bringing you more analysis throughout the day at CNET, so check back often.

It's a black background with a CRT-style green foreground color for your text that aims to offer a distraction-free application for writing. There are few bells and no whistles: this lightweight text editor is without buttons, menus, or anything else that might disturb your concentration. You can either accept the default preferences and start typing into a new document, or hit Ctrl , to open up the Preferences.

Because Dark Room starts in full-screen mode by default, you won't be able to see the menus at the top of the application. To access the Preferences from the ""View"" menu, exit full-screen mode by hitting the F11 button, then select ""View."" From the Preferences dialog, you can change the color and size of your font, the color and size of the Dark Room ""page"" (the writable area of the screen), and the color and opacity of the background (behind the page), as well as a variety of advanced settings, such as the ability to open documents in Dark Room from the Windows context menu, multiple monitor support, neutral highlighting, and autosaving.

Basic text-editing features like ""Copy,"" ""Paste,"" and ""Find,"" help you do slightly more advanced tasks, but that's about it. Users can't make global replacements, for example. Dark Room's shortcomings, though, only serve to enhance the sense of focus it can bring to your writing.",html

Just like at every WWDC, Apple has announced the winners of the Apple Design Award. According to Apple, this year's Design Awards focused on ""iPhone OS applications that demonstrate technical excellence, innovation, superior technology adoption, high performance, and outstanding design."" They have some great picks in there, so be sure to check it out.

Notably absent from this year's offerings are programs made for the Mac OS, with Apple choosing instead to include only iPhone and iPad apps. Of course, the big news of the conference was the announcement of the iPhone 4, which came not too long after the release of the iPad, so it would make sense that Apple stuck with apps for their handheld devices. But I have to wonder: is there another message here? Is Mac OS X now on the backburner for Apple now that the popularity of their handheld devices has skyrocketed? What is the future of Mac OS X? I'm interested to hear what people think, so please let me know in the comments.

This week's apps include a new and unique way to enhance your iPhone photos and a remake of a classic arcade standby from the past.

Camera+ helps you take better images with tons of features and a unique tool layout that helps you get the look you want quickly. The app offers several options for making unique-looking images out of photos on your camera roll, or you can snap pictures from within the program using Camera+'s extra tools. When taking a picture, you can use a 5x zoom slider for close-up shots, a stabilizer that automatically takes the shot when your hand is most stable, and a grid overlay so you can line up your shots as straight as possible.

Once you've got the perfect shot, Camera+ gives you several ways to enhance the image. Manage your images using the Lightbox--a backlit display area that makes it easy to find the images you want to work with. Use digital cameralike scenes to apply common camera effects in specific situations like simulated flash, sunset, backlit images, and portraits. You also can crop your images to your specs or select from several standard sizes. To make your images truly unique, you can pick from several color and retro effects that are helpfully laid out on the screen so you can preview the results before committing to an effect. Finish up by selecting a border for your image. When you're finished you can share your work on Flickr, Facebook, Twitter, or via e-mail from within the app. Overall, Camera+ is a unique and useful image tool that makes creating cool-looking shots easy. Anyone who wants to do more with their images should try this app.

Banzai Rabbit challenges you to save the world playing as a superhero rabbit mutant. The story borrows from sci-fi classic ""The Fly,"" as early on a rabbit, a flea, and two scientists get caught in a cloning accident that spawns the main character as well as his nemesis, an evil flea genius. Gameplay revolves around action like the old classic arcade game Frogger. Your job is to navigate Banzai Rabbit across traffic to save humans before they are infected by a deadly virus that transforms them into bugs.

Your enjoyment of this game depends largely on how much you like the Frogger gameplay mechanic, but Banzai Rabbit does a great job evolving the old classic into a colorful 3D world. Swipe the screen in the direction you want Banzai Rabbit to jump, being careful to avoid traffic and other obstacles all while racing against the clock. In between levels you'll be able to play through bonus rounds to score extra lives so you can advance farther into the game. Overall, if you were a fan of Frogger or want a game that has cute graphics and is easy to pick up, and has challenging gameplay and a silly storyline, Banzai Rabbit is a great choice.

What's your favorite iPhone app? Is Mac OS X going the way of the Dodo? Do you like image manipulation apps like Camera+? What do you think of Banzai Rabbit? Let me know in the comments!",html

http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/google-photos-goes-it-alone/,Google Photos goes it alone,"August,Pm,Clifford Col",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Google's photo storage and editing tools are making the jump from the Google+ sidebar to their own app. Called Google Photos, the new app is part of Google's effort to sharpen the focus of its social network by uncoupling nonessential services.

For many users, the moves are welcome. At times it has seemed overbearing of Google to put the Google+ social layer over its consumer products, such as making you sign in to Google+ to upload or comment on YouTube videos.

How to find Photos

Photos is not a renamed version of the Google+ service but a new app for Android and iOS phones and tablets. On a Mac or PC, find the Web-based service at photos.google.com, or click the Photos icon in the left sidebar of Google+ or Google Drive. Google is in the process of rolling out Photos, so you may see a message saying ""Stay tuned! Your photos are coming soon"" when you try to access the service.

If you used Google+'s photo tools, the new app should look familiar. It syncs your images across all your devices, and the edits you make in one place show up everywhere.

How to upload photos

Add photos to your library by clicking the upload photos button at the top of Photos' browser window (it's the cloud with an arrow in it) or by dragging images into the window.

You can also install a Google Photos Backup app on your Mac or PC that will automatically upload photos.

Organizing and editing

Photos organizes your images in three ways: by people, based on face recognition; by places, based on geotagging; and by things, based on what's in the photo (it can group photos of food, for example).

The editing tools are similar across desktop and mobile versions. When displaying an image, click the Pencil icon to adjust color, exposure, and lighting and add effects; to add and adjust filters; and to crop and rotate.

An Assistant wizard can build customized animations and collages from items in your library.

Sharing

Google Photos is no longer embedded in Google+, but you can still share your photos on the social network -- and on Twitter and Facebook -- by clicking the Share button.

While some photographers may miss the close connection to the Google+ community, the new Google Photos has a much broader appeal and deserves to stand alone.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10265397-2.html,Opera Unite service opens a door to the PC,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Opera has released an early version of a browser-based sharing and collaboration service called Unite, which has been criticized by some security experts as having a level of protection that is too low.

Opera Unite, an application platform that turns the user's PC into a Web server, was unveiled in an alpha version by the Norwegian company on Tuesday. Components of the browser-based service include file sharing, photo sharing, a shared media player, a chat lounge, and the ability to run Web sites hosted on the user's PC.

While the user hosting the content needs to be running a particular version of Opera 10 for Windows, Mac, and Linux, those viewing the content can do so from within any browser, including Internet Explorer or Firefox.

Opera is trying to encourage developers to create new applications that use Opera Unite. ""It all happens through the browser, so no additional software has to be downloaded, and it will work wherever Opera works (Windows, Mac, Linux and later mobile phones and other devices),"" Opera product analyst Lawrence Eng wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. ""Opera provides the platform and you provide the applications -- what you create is limited only by your imagination.""

Eng referred to the initial Opera Unite applications as ""just simple demos"" and said the platform would allow for ""a whole new class of social software on the Web ... [where] people can all connect directly without needing middlemen who control third-party servers."" He also said the service will, in time, work on mobile phones and other devices, as well as on desktop computers.

The content is shared via Opera Unite by people sending other people URLs, and the security for protecting access to the content relies entirely on passwords. However, there are two ways to do this, and one method has been criticized by analysts as potentially posing a security risk.

When a person (the host) wants to share content, there are two options: either send a URL that leads to the host's personal landing page on Opera Unite, or send a URL that links to the application within Opera Unite that relates to the content they want to share.

With the first option, the host must send the viewer a password generated by Opera Unite for them to access the application. With the second option, the URL includes the password at the end, so it is in plain view if the URL is inadvertently shared. Also, with the second option, anyone who sees the URL does not need any further details to view the content, as clicking on the link will take them directly there.

""Be a bit cautious""

A spokeswoman for Opera confirmed to ZDNet UK on Tuesday that there is no encryption involved in the Opera Unite.

Asked whether the platform could be used by someone to access data on the host's PC that the host had not chosen to share, the spokeswoman said: ""Definitely not -- unless they're a hacker.""

""Opera Unite has been tested by a number of people within Opera, so the more people we have using the service, the more we'll know about the service itself,"" the spokeswoman added. ""At this point, [you should] be a bit cautious in the files you're sharing -- only share amongst people you trust.""

Greg Day, a McAfee principal security analyst, said Opera Unite was a ""smart idea, going back to people self-hosting,"" and said there was ""some value [from a security perspective], insofar as you are in control of your own data."" However, he said there are also security risks associated with the approach.

""The [negative] is you have to have enough security integrated into the technology, or have the personal knowledge to put that security in around the technology,"" Day warned. ""The logical evolution of services like Facebook was about simplifying the process, so you rely on a third party who, in theory, has the expertise to host on your behalf and keep it secure.""

Andy Buss, a senior analyst at Canalys, said security based on the distribution of passwords was ""an avenue to disaster.""

""If there is no transport-layer security, it is easy to intercept the information being transported,"" Buss said. ""This will need to be looked at as an option.""

Another potential problem is related to intellectual-property violations, where hosts might illegally store copyrighted content on their PC and then distribute this via Opera Unite. Buss predicted that security and copyright issues will be a challenge for the next generation of internet applications, which will move a lot of activity now done on PCs to cloud-based services. ""These services are required and useful, but they have to be as secure as possible,"" Buss said.

Asked about the copyright issue, Opera's spokeswoman said that if a user was found to be distributing copyrighted material, Opera would ask the user to remove the content and, if the person did not comply, would block the account. ""This would only happen if the matter was brought to Opera's attention, as Opera does not monitor your data,"" the spokeswoman added.

https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-iwatch-rumored-for-third-quarter/,Apple iWatch rumored for third quarter,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Sarah Tew and Christopher MacManus/CNET

Will the much-rumored Apple iWatch finally debut later this year? Yes, at least according to one of the latest rumors.

Apple will reportedly unveil its long-awaited smartwatch in the third quarter of 2014, according to Taiwan's Economic Daily News. Based on an alleged bill of materials, supply chain sources told the news site that Apple is aiming to produce 65 million iWatches by year's end.

The watch itself will be manufactured by Quanta Computer, say the sources. Richtek Technology will make the chips, while TPK will create the watch's sapphire touch panels. Further, Apple is developing the watch's processor but will farm out chip production to Samsung, the sources added.

Samsung and other tech players have unveiled their own smartwatches, so Apple is already fashionably late to this party. But Apple could shake up the smartwatch market with a device that outshines rival products. Beyond pairing with your iPhone, an Apple iWatch reportedly would serve as a health and fitness tracker by tapping into an iOS 8 app called Healthbook.

This latest in a long line of iWatch rumors should certainly be taken with a grain of salt. Reports of an Apple smartwatch have been surfacing for quite a while now. But other recent reports have pegged a 2014 launch for the iWatch.

CNET contacted Apple for comment and will update the story with any further details.

Apple shares were up nearly $3 to about $526.40 in pre-market trading on Tuesday.

http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-20064011-245.html,Google fixes Android Wi-Fi security hole,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Google has plugged an Android hole that could have allowed someone to snoop on an unencrypted Wi-Fi network and access calendar and contact data on the smartphones.

""Today we're starting to roll out a fix which addresses a potential security flaw that could, under certain circumstances, allow a third-party access to data available in Calendar and Contacts,"" a Google spokesman said in a statement. ""This fix requires no action from users and will roll out globally over the next few days.""

Basically, the fix forces all Android devices to connect to Google Calendar and Contacts servers over https (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) so that someone snooping on an unprotected wireless network won't be able to grab authentication tokens used by the operating system to validate devices. Android customers will not have to do anything for the fix, which could take a couple of days to roll out to everyone.

The latest release of Android, 2.3.4 for smartphones and 3.0 for tablets, did not have the issue. But the fact that more than 99 percent of Android device owners are still using older versions was likely a factor in Google's decision to expedite a fix.

Meanwhile, Google is still looking into the whether the problem affects Picasa Web Albums, too, as was claimed in a report on the security issue by German researchers released on Friday.",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20110248-12/avast-buys-its-way-into-android-security/,Avast buys its way into Android security,"September,Pm,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Avast, a maker of popular free security suites, has announced its purchase of mobile security company ITAgents, which makes the security app for Android and Symbian called Theft Aware. Theft Aware is notable for offering SMS remote control, being resistant to phone wiping, and offering features specifically for rooted phones, in addition to more traditional lost-device mobile security features.

Avast would not disclose a purchase price for the company, although since both are privately held companies, they're not obligated to.

The purchase does not contradict the company's plans to release its own Android security solution in the fourth quarter of 2011, Avast Chief Technical Officer Ondrej Vlcek said in an e-mail to CNET. ""When we talked [this summer], we already had the LoI [Letter of Intent] with Theft Aware signed. So it's really no change in plans at all, it was part of the strategy from the very beginning.""

Vlcek said Avast plans to keep the anti-theft product as a separate product with similar pricing to what it has now, but that it will also be integrated into Avast's security suite. ""Basic features will be available in the free version of the suite, while some of the advanced features will only be present in the paid,"" he said.

Currently, Theft Aware retails for $13.55 for a license bound to one device, or $20.32 for a license that can be transferred from older devices to new ones.",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-10411601-12.html,Hands-on Chrome beta for Mac,"December,Pm,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Google released the first beta build of its Chrome browser for Mac and Linux earlier today, and it's hard not to be impressed when putting the Mac version through its paces. Chrome for Mac still lacks some of the key features that are currently available in the Windows beta, but this is a browser that most people should feel comfortable using.

As expected, Chrome on the Mac is still far superior to Firefox and even its WebKit cousin Safari when it comes to JavaScript rendering. Using the SunSpider JavaScript benchmark, Chrome came in 1.8 times faster than Firefox by scoring 738.8 milliseconds. Safari notched 1,155.8 ms, while Firefox 3.6 beta 4 completed it in 1,330 ms. This is semicasual testing, but it does provide a ballpark from which we can see the gross differences between the browser's JavaScript rendering capability.

Chrome for Mac also starts up fast, by which I mean the point from clicking the browser icon on the dock to when Google's search page has finished loading. On Chrome it took less than 2 seconds, while Firefox took slightly more than 2 seconds, and Safari was just less than 3 seconds.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Although Chrome's first non-beta for Macs is expected within the month, currently the beta doesn't have all the features of its Windows-based sibling. Most notably missing is extension support, which had been in the developer's build but was recently disabled. The timing of this is somewhat unfortunate, considering that Google just officially launched the Chrome extensions gallery. It also lacks bookmark syncing, the bookmark manager, and the cookie manager.

When firing up a site, Chrome will occasionally show nothing but white space until the page is finished loading. In several hours of hands-on use, this was the only experiential flaw encountered--although the beta could easily be hiding more.

Even with these drawbacks, Google Chrome beta makes for an excellent quick-use browser on the Mac, and can be more or less used with confidence on a regular basis, if not as a go-to browser.",html
http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/windows-10-your-questions-answered,Windows 10: your questions answered,"July,Pm,Tom Mcnamara",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Try as we might, we can't anticipate every question about Windows 10, which. So we asked you, and you have delivered. We've answered as many as we can, though some things we just don't know yet. Keep sending your questions, and we'll post more answers. Our review of the operating system may also provide some answers.

Recording TV with Windows Media Center

""I have an HDHomeRun digital cable TV tuner. How will I be able to use it to watch and record TV programs on Windows 10 if there is no Media Center?"" --Gary

Windows 10 will not have the Media Center, and upgrading from Windows 7 will remove it. And unfortunately, there is no replacement for Windows Media Center, which was the only Windows platform authorized to make recordings of encrypted cable transmissions. On the bright side, Microsoft has committed to providing security updates to Windows 7 until 2020. So you can stick with Windows 7 for now and wait for a replacement to arrive, or you can try dual-booting Windows 7 and Windows 10.

Postponing the upgrade to Windows 10

""I do not want to consider Windows 10 for several months, until its kinks are worked out and I can truly decide if I want it. However, I received the Win10 upgrade notification, and I want to know if I can stop the automatic download."" --jjoek

The upgrade to Windows 10 won't be automatic. The upgrade notification icon will just stay in your system tray to remind you that your upgrade is available.

Adjusting from Windows 7

""I'm confused how Windows 10 can be an upgrade for both Windows 7 and 8.1. Windows 8.1 I can understand, although for whatever reason, there is no Windows 9. At least it's a short leap from 8.1 to 10. However, with Windows 7 it's a big leap to 10, skipping over Windows 8 and 8.1. Does Windows 10 include both 8.0 and 8.1, so Windows 7 isn't overwhelmed by the giant leap?"" --Cris C.

Having used various versions of Windows 10 over the last several months, we can say that it should feel familiar to people who never upgraded to Windows 8 or 8.1. Microsoft brought back the Start menu, and you'll only see the screen full of tiles if you're running a device with a touch-based interface, like a tablet or a Windows phone. For the rest of us, Windows 10 is designed to boot straight to the desktop mode that we're familiar with. The Task Manager uses Windows 8's style, but it's arguably an improvement, or at least a more informative one. The Control Panel (now accessed from the Settings button on the Start menu) uses a different layout, but you can still use the search function there to find what you're looking for.

Cloud storage in Windows 10

""I have very slow Internet speeds. Does Windows 10 use the cloud for most programs?"" --Neal R.

Windows 10 will encourage you to use the pre-installed OneDrive service (formerly called SkyDrive) to store your documents, photos, and other files in Microsoft's cloud, but it's not required. The Windows 10 Start menu uses ""live tiles"" that are updated over the Internet with news, weather, and stock info, but you can disable them by right-clicking and selecting Unpin From Start Menu. The Siri-like Cortana assistant may transmit information over the Internet, depending on what you ask it to do. But overall, the main activities of the operating system that customarily operate offline do not require an Internet connection in Windows 10.

Keeping multiple versions of Windows on your computer

""My desktop PC is currently a dual-boot system running XP and Windows 7. I would like to keep my XP. Can I upgrade the Win 7 portion only and leave the XP portion intact?"" --Rick W.

Yes, as long as you have a partition on your storage device set aside for installing a second operating system. If that's the case, use the custom installation option and point it to the second partition. If you do not have a partition set aside, the process to create one can get a little complicated and would require a separate article to explain. Our CNET colleagues have an article about dual-booting Windows 7 and Windows 8 that should work for people who don't have a partition set up already.

While you can install Windows 10 as an update to 7 or 8.1 in a partition, as far as we know you cannot use the free upgrade to create a brand-new installation of Windows 10 on a separate partition or other device. It can only be used to upgrade Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. If you want to install a full version of Windows 10 instead of an upgrade, you'll need to buy a copy of the operating system.

Restoration partitions

""Will the Windows 10 upgrade delete the manufacturer's restoration partition on a Windows 7 computer?"" --Bill R.

This is a section of your computer's storage device that is created by the manufacturer (Dell, HP, Toshiba, and so on) to restore the operating system to the state it was in when the device was shipped. You can use this if your computer gets messed up and if less destructive fixes don't work. The Windows 10 installer won't mess with existing partitions unless you tell it to, so this restoration partition will be unaffected. Keep in mind, though, that using the restoration partition will return you to the previous operating system that's stored there, not to Windows 10.

Windows XP mode in Windows 10

""We have two Windows 7 computers bought in the last two years, but we have an accounting program which will only run in Windows XP. I understand that there is a virtual XP which can be downloaded into Windows 7, but can it be downloaded into Windows 10?"" --Eileen S.

It doesn't look like Windows 10 will have support for Windows XP Mode. However, you can install Windows XP in a virtual machine. I wrote an article recently about installing Windows 10 in a virtual machine -- you can apply those same steps to creating one for Windows XP. Running a virtual machine requires more processing power than XP Mode, but since you bought your PC fairly recently, it should be up to the task.

The Windows 10 update schedule

""I've always have had Windows on my PCs, but since 1986, I've learned to wait for any product from Microsoft to be X.1 or X.2.0, because they haven't done very well with first releases of many of their products. Will Windows 10.1 be available before next July?"" --Ronald R.

If you're wondering whether a major revision of Windows 10 will be available before the upgrade offer expires on July 29, 2016...that's a pretty good question, actually. Windows 7 was released to retail in October 2009, and its service pack didn't arrive until February 2011. Windows 8.1 came out a little over a year after Windows 8.0. But with all the changes that the company has been evolving through since CEO Satya Nadella took over in February 2014, we don't know if Microsoft will be using the same game plan as before. There may not be a Windows 10.1 as a retail product, if they take the route that Apple has with OS X.

Whatever the case, we've found the Insider Preview version of Windows 10 to be quite stable. This is due in part to it sharing a lot of proven DNA with previous versions of Windows. It's not a major leap like Windows 3.1 to Windows 95, or 95 to XP.

Keeping previously installed versions of Microsoft programs

""What is this about Office 2016? I own 2013 and do not want to pay for the same software every year. If I download and install Windows 10, do I have to accept Office 16? Will it overwrite my 2013 Office?"" --Ronald R.

When you upgrade from Windows 7 or 8.1, you copy of Microsoft Office will remain unaffected. The Windows 10 upgrade does not include a copy of Office 2016. However, Windows 10 will install Microsoft Edge alongside Internet Explorer 11. Edge is intended to be the successor to IE 11, though the latter will still operate as a fallback.

Device compatibility with Windows 10

""Years ago, when I upgraded to Windows 7, I consulted a Windows 7 compatibility webpage. It listed software that was and wasn't compatible. My webcam wasn't compatible with Win 7, and I needed to download a patch so that my printer would work with it. What about Windows 10? Will it be compatible with all software/hardware that works with Windows 7?"" --Bill P.

The Windows 10 upgrade notification icon (which will show up in your Windows system tray if you qualify for the upgrade) has a built-in tool to check for device compatibility. Our friends at ZDNet have a short article that walks you through how that works. As far as we know, Microsoft does not have a webpage this time to check for compatibility with Windows 10.

Re-installing Windows 10 later

""Once I have installed Windows 10 on my computer, what happens if I have to change my hard drive at a later date? How do I re-install Windows 10? And do I get an installation code with the Windows 10 download?"" --Nic

Ideally you're creating backups of your Windows 10 drive or partition on a regular basis, so you can restore from that if something happens to your main drive. If you need to reinstall Windows 10, the free offer is only for an upgrade from Windows 7 or 8.1, so you'd need to install one of those older operating systems first before upgrading them to Windows 10. We've been able to to do a full OS installation using an upgrade installer in the past, but it's not clear if that will be possible with Windows 10. And it would be a violation of the license agreement anyway.

SAN FRANCISCO--PacketVideo, creator of an interconnected multimedia streaming suite dubbed TwonkyMedia, will officially push out its mobile complement at the end CTIA's Fall 2010 conference on Friday, but that didn't stop the company from showing off the app at a swanky cocktail party in a SOMA loft a bit ahead of schedule.

Twonky Mobile is rather aptly described by the diagram at right, which we swiped off the Twonky Web site. In layman's terms, the app turns any Android phone into a really fancy universal remote for just about any networked media device on the market today, including the Apple TV, the Sonos systems, the Logitech Squeezebox, the XBox 360, and many more. All you need is the network password for any given spot and you're good to go.

The Twonky app can access any media on your phone, including the onboard library and any variety of Web favorites, such as YouTube, Flckr, and Last.fm. (Last.fm is a part of CBS Interactive, which also publishes CNET Reviews.) You can then stream the content to compatible devices, and control playback with your phone. Switching between different devices (such as your home setup and that of a friend) is a simple task of pulling up a connections menu and selecting the new output from the list.

Twonky

In addition, Twonky Mobile is multitask compliant, so you can continue to take calls and use other functions of the phone without interrupting the media stream. You can also seamlessly sync content back to your PC, if you have the Twonky Manger software installed.

The app is currently available for Android only, with plans to expand to iOS in the future. You can find a free download by searching the Marketplace.",html

Available this summer, iPhone 3.0 will bring many features people have asked for and some that will make things easier for developers of iPhone apps. The two major ones on my list were finally added: MMS (sending photos and other media) and the ability to cut, copy, and paste text. There are a ton of changes coming, so check out our coverage if you want to know all of the changes in iPhone 3.0.

This week's apps include a quick and easy way to measure bandwidth and a simple game that somehow manages to keep you coming back for more.

Speed Test (free) from Speedtest.net quickly tests your bandwidth speed wherever you are. A sleek blue speedometer comes to life when you hit the ""Start Test"" button, first measuring your download speed (the time it takes for data from the server to get to your iPhone), then upload speed (the time it takes for data from your iPhone to get to the server). You can then save the results, making it easy to track available bandwidth in different locations. By moving to different locations, you can even find out which parts of your house get a better Wi-Fi connection--useful if you want to download or update a big app.

10 Balls 7 Cups (99 cents) is a surprisingly fun and challenging Skeeball game for the iPhone and iPod Touch. Using crisp 3D graphics and a realistic physics engine, this game manages to capture what it's like to play Skeeball in an arcade. Each game you get 10 balls you can roll down the alley in an attempt to make them land in one of the seven cups of varying score values. Tilt your iPhone to add spin as your ball rolls down the alley. While playing, random cups will light up, and if you manage to land a ball in the cup, you get a score multiplier that lasts until the end of the game. Hit another lit-up cup to increase your multiplier. At the end, you receive tickets depending on your score that you can use to purchase silly items in the store.

When I first saw this game, I thought about how much I liked playing Skeeball as a kid, but didn't think it would translate well for the iPhone (or I would get bored quickly). But soon I was playing game after game, trying to get bonus multipliers, and getting higher scores. The only problem I have with this casual game is that there are no graphics for the silly items (Finger trap! Glittery T-shirt! Submarine (rare)!) in the store. But overall, this simple game is a great time-waster. If you're still not convinced, watch the trailer (I couldn't resist).

http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/first-look-ios-10/,First look: iOS 10,"July,Am,Joshua Rotter",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Apple's iOS 10 is due this fall, along with MacOS Sierra, and you can expect new features, including Home. But mostly the release will bring much-desired optimizations to Messages, Maps, Music, and Photos, plus little perks like finally letting you delete some of Apple's native apps.

Don't want to wait until fall? You can preview iOS 10 through Apple's public beta program. You need, at minimum, an iPhone 5, iPad 4, iPad Air, iPad Mini 2, or an iPad Pro (or a more recent version of any of those devices). Be sure to to create an iTunes or iCloud backup, in case something goes awry or you want to revert to a previous update. Then go download the iOS 10 beta. Read on for our tour of iOS 10's highlights.

Messages

Apple's native messaging app comes to life with new, more dynamic ways to communicate. Open up Messages and tap the arrow to discover two new options alongside the camera icon: App Store and Heartbeat.

App Store. Tap App Store to see a menu button that opens up Recents, Store, Music, and #images. You can also use App Store to access apps without leaving Messages, such as Venmo to make payments. Music lets you share what you're currently listening to, and use #images to search and send photos and GIFs from Apple's extensive library.

Heartbeat. Once only an Apple Watch feature, Heartbeat opens a pad where you can sketch a word or drawing in one of seven colors. Your friends will see it render as if you were writing it on their screen. Hold your fingers down on the pad to send your heartbeat in a heart-shaped box, or get someone's attention by sending a tap (it looks like a circle).

More visual messages and quick responses. Type ""Happy birthday"" and balloons will overtake your friend's screen. Type ""Congratulations"" and confetti will fall. Tap your recipient's message bubbles and send one of six quick responses, including a heart, thumbs up, thumbs down, Haha, exclamation points, and question marks. Or tap the emoji icon to swap out words for emoji. Typing is less of a chore when contextual predictions kick in. Type something like ""I'm available at,"" and the app autosuggests free times from your calendar.

Additional new features include the abilities to draw over videos (as in Snapchat), change the look of message bubbles, send text in invisible ink (which your recipient can open with a swipe), and type in two languages simultaneously.

Maps

Reservations and suggestions. With iOS 10, you'll be able to book OpenTable and Uber reservations in Maps. Maps gets proactive with suggestions based on where you are and tells you the fastest way to get there -- see which gas stations, restaurants, and coffee shops are nearby. However, we couldn't test this feature, because the third-party apps that can connect to Maps aren't live yet.

News

Topics. The News app now breaks up articles by topic, so you can find the stories you're interested in more quickly.

Photos

Photo groupings and Memories. Photos now scans your iCloud library and groups photos by specific people, animals, places, or events. A search bar up top so you can look for them based on keywords. The Memories function takes photos from important events and puts them together in mini movies, backed by music. Unfortunately, we couldn't get any Memories videos to play in our iOS 10 beta.

Music

For You. To compete with Spotify's excellent Discover, Apple Music now has a For You page that puts music recommendations, specifically for you, in one place. Whether you're playing an old favorite or a new discovery, you'll see the lyrics at the same time.

Pay

Online shopping. Apple Pay, once reserved for in-person purchases, is now available for online shopping. When it's time to purchase, just tap the Pay button.

Home

Remote control. The new Home app connects to your HomeKit-ready appliances, so you can control your house lights, doors, and shades with your phone or tablet. If you add appliances to the app, they will be accessible from your Control Center's third pane.

Siri

Siri for non-Apple apps. Siri is now integrated within many of your favorite third-party apps, so you can ask it to book an Uber for you, Venmo a friend some money, or post on Facebook.

Extras

Raise to Wake. Turn on your phone just by picking it up.

Rich notifications. Check out photos and videos or answer messages directly from your notifications.

Widgets. Native apps like Calendar, Weather, and Stocks now have little widgets that you can see on your lock screen. Use 3D Touch to peek into the information you need.

Bedtime and wake-up reminders. Open the Clock app and tap Bedtime on the bottom rail to access this wonderful new feature. Answer a handful of questions -- such as how many hours of sleep you'd like, when you'd like to be reminded to go to sleep, and when you want to wake up -- and select the relaxing music you'd like to wake up to, and Apple will push you to get your beauty sleep.

Native app deletion. You can finally remove some of Apple's native apps, such as News, Stocks, or the Apple Watch app. However, you can't delete Health, Photos, Wallet, or the App Store.

However, by allowing the browser to stagnate after the release of Windows XP in 2001, Microsoft created an opening that paved the way for the rise of Firefox and, more recently, Google's Chrome.

As a result Internet Explorer celebrates its 15th birthday Monday as market leader and like an upstart trying to compete against powerful rivals.

IE through the years As Microsoft's browser turns 15, a look back at how it's evolved. 1995: Internet Explorer 1.0

The first version of IE came in August 1996, a month after Microsoft released Windows 95. The browser was not part of the operating system, but instead was included as part of an ""Internet Jumpstart Kit"" in the Microsoft Plus add-in. 1995: Internet Explorer 2.0

In November 1995, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 2.0, its first browser to offer both Macintosh and Windows support. IE 2.0 also added support for the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, HTTP cookies, and Internet newsgroups. 1996: Internet Explorer 3.0

Released in August 1996, IE3 included support for e-mail, the display of GIF and JPG files, and direct playback of streaming audio without the need for additional applications. 1997: Internet Explorer 4.0

IE4 added support for Dynamic HTML (DHTML), which allowed for interactive Web sites where menus could be expanded or images could be moved around. IE4 also brought the arrival of Microsoft Outlook Express 4, an improvement to the mail and newsgroup readers that had been part of IE. 1998: Internet Explorer 5.0

Released in September 1998, IE5 expanded on the support for DHTML and allowed for greater personalization. 2001: Internet Explorer 6

Released as part of Windows XP, Internet Explorer 6 became the standard in Web browsing for years, eventually to the dismay of the entire industry, including Microsoft itself, which has struggled to move customers to more modern and secure versions of its browser. 2006: Internet Explorer 7

Released in October 2006 for users of Windows XP Service Pack 2 and later as part of Windows Vista, IE7 added support for tabbed browsing along with antimalware protection. 2009: Internet Explorer 8

Released in March 2009, Internet Explorer 8 was an attempt by Microsoft to modernize its underlying browsing engine. Other features included support for creating small ""Web clips"" of a portion of a Web site as well as the use of ""accelerators"" to take action on a highlighted piece of text. A version of IE8 was also built in as part of Windows 7. 2011?: Internet Explorer 9

Internet Explorer 9 is the next major update to IE, adding improved HTML5 support, a faster JavaScript engine, and the ability to tap a PC's graphics chip to accelerate text and graphics. Microsoft has released several platform previews and a beta is planned for September. Microsoft has not said when the final release will come, but it is unlikely to be this year. Source: Microsoft and CNET



Arguably, the browser has never been more important--or competitive. As of July, Microsoft had just over 60 percent of the market, gaining share for two months in a row after years of ceding ground to Firefox and Chrome. Firefox, meanwhile, held about 23 percent, Chrome about 7 percent, and Apple's Safari roughly 5 percent, according to Net Applications.

Google is trying to make the case that not only does it have the best browser in Chrome, but further that the browser--and the Web-based services it connects to--have grown so capable that basic PCs basically need nothing else. That argument will be turned into a product later this year when the first Chrome OS-based Netbooks are scheduled to hit the market.

For its part, Microsoft is counting on an improved Internet Explorer to help its argument that the PC and Windows still matter. With Internet Explorer 9, the company is trying to both reassert itself in the browser wars and show the power of the PC by expanding the browser to tap the graphics power inherent in modern computers.

Redmond has already released a few technical previews of IE9 and is working on a beta version of IE9, set to be released September 15. The company hasn't said when to expect a final version of the browser, but it appears unlikely to happen in 2010. Next spring's Mix trade show seems a reasonable target.

While Microsoft works on the next version of IE, here at CNET we decided to take a look back at Redmond's sometimes troubled history with its browser. What started as a me-too competitor to Netscape's browser at the beginning of the dot-com boom quickly became the main point of contention in Microsoft's antitrust battles with U.S. and European regulators.

At the heart of those fights was a simple question still being asked in computing: Is the operating system or the browser more important? At Microsoft, the answer split the difference: The browser should be part of the operating system. And that's where the trouble began.

Humble beginnings

Internet Explorer made its debut on August 16, 1995, just one month after Microsoft released Windows 95. The browser was part of something called the Internet Jumpstart Kit that was part of the Microsoft Plus add-on to Windows 95.

The browser's origins can be traced to the company's big Internet Strategy Day in which Microsoft announced it had recognized the Internet and would be adding Net capabilities to all of its products. Microsoft got much of the code by licensing the Mosaic browser from Spyglass.

Internet Explorer didn't immediately oust Netscape from the market, with Redmond's rival managing to hold on to more than half of the market through 1997.

A key move for Microsoft came with IE 3.0, which Microsoft included in the operating system--a move that led to significant antitrust scrutiny for Microsoft starting in 1996 and continuing until as recently as last year when Microsoft was told by the European Union that the inclusion of a browser in Windows appeared to violate its laws.

Redmond threatened to pull the browser out of Windows entirely in Europe--a move that would have not only made it hard to use IE--but also to download any other browser. However, the company relented and instead has agreed to use a ""ballot screen"" in Europe that lets PC buyers or those upgrading Windows choose which browser or browsers they want to install.

Elsewhere, IE remains an integrated part of Windows, though there are options that allow most of its features to be hidden.

Despite its popularity, IE has drawn much scorn from developers and users, particularly the venerable IE6 browser that shipped as part of Windows XP. Even Microsoft itself has been trying to get users off of IE6, but its long life (and that of XP) means that it has remained despite the ire.

The modern browser wars

After winning the first battle against Netscape, Microsoft settled into a slow pace of small evolutions with the browser that tended to come only as Redmond updated Windows itself.

IE6 got a significant security update along with Windows XP with Service Pack 2. However, because Microsoft didn't have a major release of Windows from 2001 until Vista in 2006, IE failed to keep pace on the innovation front, while Firefox continued to add features such as tabbed browsing.

Microsoft caught up a little bit on the features front with IE7 and with IE8, which debuted last year, the company aimed to make up some ground on the standards front.

However, IE9, still in development, is the company's big bet on offering a browser that can compete technically with browsers from Google, Mozilla, and Apple.

Microsoft hasn't said much about how the browser will look, but it has hinted that it aims for a more minimalistic approach.

""The browser is the theater,"" Microsoft's Ryan Gavin said in an interview last week. ""We're not the play. You don't want the theater to block the view.""",html

The differences between the two versions are enumerated here; the short of it is that the extras are nice--but they're merely extras.

MySpaceIM is supported, and Skype is included, but it requires the program to be running before it can be accessed through Astra--just as Skype does with other multichat applications. It includes POP3 and IMAP account notifications rolled in alongside the Facebook and Web mail notices.

Perhaps most importantly, the Cerulean Studios team promises that Trillian Astra will be updated more frequently than Trillian 3 ever was, with regular maintenance patches.

Browser usage statistics for September provide a look at who's gaining clout on the Web: Google's Chrome, twin mobile powerhouses Apple iOS and Google Android, and Microsoft's IE9.

Google's Chrome browser continued its steady rise in usage on NetApplications' network of thousands of Web sites, which get tens of millions of visits monthly, increasing from 7.5 percent in August to 8 percent in September, the analytics firm said.

Microsoft's Internet Explorer remains the top-ranked browser, but its share dipped back below 60 percent, sinking from 60.4 percent to 59.7 percent. Second-place Firefox was essentially flat at 23 percent. Apple's Safari rose a tenth of a point to 5.3 percent. Opera kept its 2.4 percent share.

Chrome is a rising force, a fact that's very useful for Google's ambitions. Not only does it help spread the Google brand, but it also serves as a vehicle to disseminate Google technologies. For example, on Thursday, Google said it will add support for its new WebP image format to Chrome in an effort to speed browser graphics. And it's working to improve the browser: Chrome 7 is getting Google Instant search abilities, some hardware acceleration, and WebGL 3D graphics support by default.

Net Applications' September statistics gave a look at how widely used IE9 is now that it's in beta: with a share of 0.25 percent for the last two weeks of September, that's a respectable 1 of every 400 Web pages.

Microsoft, after a long dormant period, is back in fighting shape for the browser wars with IE9, which in beta form features more extensive hardware acceleration than Chrome. IE9 is notable for its support of Web standards, including a host of newer standards that Web developers are eager to implement.

But standards support isn't an easy matter for Microsoft. For years, Microsoft's IE, not Web standards, was the technology for which developers coded their Web sites. To deal with this legacy of non-standard Web pages, IE uses a ""compatibility mode"" by which it renders pages using its older rendering rules.

The Net Applications statistics show just how often IE must call upon the compatibility mode. For the IE9 beta, this compatibility mode is used for about one of each eight pages. Clearly it will be a long time before the Web is fully modernized for the post-IE era.

Some of the most interesting trends in the browser market are with mobile devices, a much less mature market than browsing on personal computers.

Mobile browsing is exploding in usage with a new generation of devices coming to market. In October 2009, it accounted for 1.1 percent of all browsing, but by September 2010, that figure grew to 2.8 percent, Net Applications said.

A new class of smartphones and mobile devices is dominating that usage.

Apple's iOS devices--the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad--account for 1.2 percent of browser usage. That's up from 0.4 percent in October 2009.

Google's Android operating system, which is chiefly used in mobile phones but is beginning to arrive in tablets that compete with the iPad, lags well behind but is growing. Its share of browsing rose from 0.02 percent in October 2009 to 0.24 percent in September 2010.

The statistics don't reflect a large element of mobile Net usage through applications, however. Although iOS and Android browsers outclass the mobile browsers that came before, they're still slower than on PCs and hard to use with small screens in many cases. Many companies therefore choose to make their Net-connected services accessible through applications rather than just Web sites.",html

Panda Security, publishers of Panda Internet Security and Panda Antivirus, is set to take antivirus where it hasn't been yet: into the clouds. Panda Cloud Antivirus beta bets that nearly three years of development can pay off into a better protection system for users. To that end, Panda's willing to make the client free for personal use--even after it leaves beta testing.

You can also download the program from CNET Download.com.

The program uses Panda's proprietary cloud computing technology, which they call Collective Intelligence, to detect viruses, malware, rootkits, and heuristics. It takes advantage of ""millions of users,"" according to Panda, to identify new malware almost in real time. Panda says that Collective Intelligence can classify new malware in under six minutes, and that it handles more than 50,000 new samples per day. The Cloud Antivirus works by classifying threats into executables that must be scanned immediately, and non-executables that are checked at a lower priority--usually when the computer is idle.

In exchange for using consumer data to build the Collective Intelligence database, Panda decided to offer the Panda Cloud Antivirus for free, said Pedro Bustamante, senior research adviser at Panda Security.

(Credit: Panda Security)

The new program reportedly takes up around 50 MB on the hard drive and eats around 17 MB of RAM when in use. That compares well against the industry average that Panda provided of 60 MB, and Bustamante said that they're aiming for 12 MB of RAM when in use.

Cloud computing may make sense from a system resources point of view, but what happens to system security when the computer isn't connected to the Internet? ""The model we've implemented is to break down the traditional antivirus to client and server, so when the user is not connected they keep a local cache copy of Collective Intelligence, including detections for what Collective Intelligence sees is spreading through the community,"" he said.

Panda Cloud Antivirus is for Windows XP and Windows Vista, with planned support for Windows 7 when it's released. Bustamante added that it will stay in beta as it's being accepted by users, although they hope it will leave beta by the end of this summer.",html
http://news.cnet.com/chrome-begins-rss-support-solidifies-extensions/,"Chrome begins RSS support, solidifies extensions",,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Google has begun work on one much-requested feature of its Chrome browser, the ability to detect when a Web page offers a subscription service through RSS or Atom technology.

Google programmer Finnur Thorarinsson formally marked the RSS support issue as ""started"" on Wednesday, though the feature is disabled for now.

""The first part of this has been implemented and checked in,"" Thorarinsson said, referring to the part that discovers when RSS feeds are available on a Web site. The feature is disabled for now, though, because the second part, which will produce a page that lets people actually subscribe to the feed, isn't yet available, he said in his comment about Chrome's RSS support.

When Chrome debuted in September, many often basic features available in rival browsers were missing. Google has been working feverishly to add them, though. A total of 250 people flagged RSS support as being an issue of interest, second only to the Chrome extensions, which 725 people flagged.

Google is working on extensions, too, which will let people customize the browser with features such as ad blocking. Extensions are a popular selling point with Firefox, the second most popular browser after Microsoft's Internet Explorer.

Earlier this week, Google programmer Aaron Boodman published a how-to guide for writing Chrome extensions. ""Right now extensions can only really contain content scripts, so that is all this doc covers. But we'll be expanding it over time as more features develop,"" Boodman said in an e-mail announcement of the how-to document.

The document caught the attention of another Googler--Matt Cutts, who oversees Google's efforts to screen Web spam out of search results but who also blogs more broadly. ""I'm sure the Chrome team is thinking about ways to add more functionality to extensions, but the current developer version of Chrome already lets you do a lot of neat things,"" Cutts said in a blog post about using the Chrome extensions framework.

Boodman, though, followed up with a note of caution in a blog post of his own that said Cutts jumped the gun. ""There's not much to see yet,"" he said. ""We're working on more toys, and you can bet we'll start blogging when there's something to play with. But not... quite... yet.""",html

I had a chance to walk the expo floor on Thursday and though there weren't nearly as many vendors as in years past, I was able to talk to a few iPhone developers about their products and all seemed excited about showing off their latest projects.

Even though Apple is no longer in attendance at Macworld, Moscone North was crowded with throngs of Mac and iPhone fans, looking at the latest software, peripherals, and gear. While the big Apple stage that usually dominates the middle of every expo was noticeably absent, plenty of vendors filled up the void with iPhone case displays, storage solutions, product demos, and much more. I had thought that Macworld would suffer greatly in Apple's absence, but you wouldn't know it by talking to anyone at the expo. Hopefully, the many Mac peripheral vendors and iPhone developers will continue the Macworld tradition. It would be sad to see the expo with such a storied history end.

When Moto X Mayhem (99 cents) was first released, I wrote (in August of last year) that you could play a very similar game online for free. Though I liked the mechanics of the original game, it was hard for me to recommend anyone pay for it if there was only one track. Maybe the guys at Occamy Games were listening because subsequent updates have added two additional islands of courses, making this game well worth the price tag.

In the game, you use your accelerometer to lean forward or back, press the right side of the screen to accelerate, and press the left to brake, as you navigate your way through a 2D course. You get 10 lives to try to complete seven different courses on each island. The graphics are cartoon-smooth and the controls are excellent, making it easy to pick up and play, yet challenging to master all three islands of courses. Overall, if you liked the original or were reluctant to pay for the single track in the earlier version, I highly recommend the new and improved Moto X Mayhem. It's a great time-waster that makes it easy to get a couple of runs in wherever you are.

Space Miner: Space Ore Bust ($4.99) takes the old arcade classic Asteroids and mixes in some RPG elements and a sense of humor to create a truly entertaining game. Most of your time is spent mining different sectors of open space, using an onscreen joystick to turn and buttons for thrust and fire. By itself, blowing away the asteroids is pretty fun, but there's much more to Space Miner than a simple arcade shooter. You warp to sectors from your base, a mining facility run by your Uncle Jeb (which offers a store to buy new ships and ship components). You also have an apartment on the station where you can view your stats. Most of the funny storyline plays out through conversations with cartoon-like characters in between missions on the station.

Space Miner: Space Ore Bust has a southern country feel, with banjo music, ships that look vaguely like semi trucks, and dialogue that fits right in with the down-home theme. As you progress, you'll gain new licenses that let you explore more difficult sectors as you mine for ore and blow away enemies. Each load of ore adds to your money total, letting you buy new ships and parts to increase gun damage, strengthen your hull, improve your engines, and increase tractor beam strength for easier ore collection. The RPG elements are truly well done, making it easy to get addicted to this game as you try to build the ultimate mining and fighting machine. Overall, with the funny storyline involving cleaning up Uncle Jeb's mining operation, the ability to improve your ship, the non-linear sandbox-like layout, and the familiar Asteroids core gameplay, this game is perfect for those who have been looking for a casual RPG.

What's your favorite iPhone app? Is Moto X Mayhem a worthwhile purchase now that they've added the new content? Are you as impressed with Space Miner: Space Ore Bust as I am? Let me know in the comments!",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-33200_3-57344218-290/chrome-scores-a-victory-in-the-browser-wars/,Chrome scores a victory in the browser wars,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"It's just one browser version during one particular week, and only one research firm is making the claim--but according to StatCounter, Google's Chrome 15 is the world's most popular browser.

Google

In the last week of November, StatCounter says, 23.6 percent of the browsers tracked by its global system were Chrome 15. Microsoft's Internet Explorer 8 accounted for 23.5 percent.

Add up all versions of IE and Chrome and you still get a different story: IE is the most popular browser overall, well ahead of Chrome. StatCounter's numbers still show all versions of IE taking a total of 40.09 percent of the market, vs. 26.31 percent for all versions of Chrome. Firefox is at 25.07 percent, Apple's Safari is at 5.86 percent, and Opera gets 1.91 percent.

Chrome 15's victory isn't hugely meaningful. Google's built-in updating system quietly but insistently auto-updates users to new versions, reducing the number of people who are running old editions of the browser. Microsoft, by contrast, is less pushy. That helps explain why a meaningful number of folks still run the ancient, obsolete, insecure mess known as Internet Explorer 6.

In January, Microsoft plans to use Windows Update's Auto Updates to upgrade recalcitrant Windows users to newer versions of Internet Explorer--IE 8 for Windows XP, and IE 9 for Windows Vista and 7. Given Chrome 15's extremely narrow victory over IE 8 and the massive number of Windows XP PCs in the world, IE 8 presumably has a decent chance at snatching its crown back next month.

The real history-making moment would come if Chrome--or any non-Microsoft browser--overtook IE to become the world's most popular browser, period. (The numbers reported by StatCounter and its rivals vary enough that I wouldn't believe it had happened until every major stats service agreed.)

The last market-leading browser that wasn't IE was Netscape Navigator. When its share crumbled in the 1990s, Internet Explorer gained a monopoly on the market that looked like it would probably be permanent.

By coming pre-installed on Windows, Internet Explorer still gets a huge head start over every other browser on the planet: It's remarkable that the race is as close as it is. I wouldn't reject the possibility of Chrome eventually overtaking IE, though, particularly given how rapidly it's improving and how aggressively Google markets it.

Of course, a few years ago I thought that Firefox also had a shot at surpassing IE . Back in the days when Internet Explorer 6 was the current version of IE, and commanded more than 90 percent of the market, Firefox was downright dazzling. Simply by being wonderful, it quickly racked up millions of users--and forever disproved the depressing conventional wisdom that it was impossible to compete with Windows' default browser.

When Google unveiled Chrome a little over three years ago, Firefox probably lost its chance at taking the top slot. All of a sudden, Chrome was the fresh, innovative alternative browser--and recently, Firefox's share has flatlined, then dipped.

If open-source Firefox had managed to overtake IE, it would have been one of the great stories in tech history: A bunch of volunteer geeks banding together to beat the world's biggest software company. If Chrome takes the lead, it'll be one huge company beating another huge company. For me, at least, the emotional impact wouldn't be the same.

And in a strange way, Microsoft is also a scrappy upstart when it comes to browsers. IE 9, the current version, is downright good, and admirably progressive when it comes to new technologies and standards. (Microsoft does its best work when its products have meaningful competition. Weird, huh?)

So I'm not rooting for any particular browser, and won't take it badly if IE remains the most popular one for years to come. But boy, am I glad that the browser wars--which some once thought were over--show no signs of ending anytime soon.",html

iOS 8 allows for third-party keyboards in the App Store. Meaning, developers such as Swype and SwiftKey will finally have the opportunity to bring their popular Android keyboards to iOS.

We can expect to see keyboard apps in the App Store shortly after iOS 8's launch. Once you download a new keyboard from the App Store, you'll need to take a couple of extra steps to get it running on your device.

Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET

Keyboard apps will install an app icon, just like any other app, on your iOS device. Most of the time this is where you can find personalization settings and options for the keyboard.

To activate a new keyboard:

Tap the app icon to open it.

Then, go to your iOS Settings

Then go to General > Keyboards > Add New Keyboard.

Just below the suggested keyboards section is where you'll find a list of installed third-party keyboards.

Tap on the name of the keyboard you'd like to activate, and enable the languages you want to use (assuming the keyboard allows for multiple languages).

To switch between keyboards, tap on the Globe icon on the keyboard when entering text. Doing so will cycle through all enabled keyboards you have on your device. To help cut down on jumping between multiple keyboards, you can disable the default iOS keyboard with a simple swipe-to-delete gesture -- a swipe to the left -- on the same Keyboards screen mentioned above.

In order to help better protect your privacy, Apple has some rules about where a custom keyboard can and can't be present. For example, password prompts will likely default to the stock iOS keyboard.

Is there a particular keyboard you're looking forward to, or hope makes its way to iOS 8?

https://www.cnet.com/news/congress-just-killed-the-online-privacy-rules-now-what-faq/,Here's how the death of online privacy rules affects you,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Now Playing: Watch this: What the repeal of internet privacy rules means to you

Obama-era rules designed to regulate how broadband companies handle your private information online are on their way out.

As of Tuesday, both houses of Congress have voted to repeal regulations adopted last year by the Federal Communications Commission. The next step is a signature from President Donald Trump, who has already signaled he's eager to get rid of the regulation.

Marguerite Reardon/CNET

This follows efforts by new FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to put the brakes on stricter requirements on broadband companies to protect your data from hackers. Consumer advocacy groups argue that such rules protect your privacy, while internet service providers say the regulations are too strict and aren't fair because they don't apply to online companies like Facebook or Google.

So what's all this mean for consumers? CNET has put together this FAQ to help explain.

What just happened?

The House of Representatives on Tuesday voted 215-205 to stop FCC regulations from taking effect that would have required broadband and wireless companies to ask your permission before sharing sensitive information about you, such as the websites you visit, the apps you use or even your location. The rules would have also set standards for broadband providers to protect information they collect and store. And they would have set requirements for when and how companies would inform you if your data was stolen.

The House vote follows a 50-48 vote in the Senate, which invoked the Congressional Review Act. This law gives Congress the power to override regulations adopted by federal agencies before they go into effect.

Tuesday's vote basically kills rules that the Democrat-led FCC adopted in October. Now that bill will go to Trump to sign.

Had these rules gone into effect?

No. The FCC voted 2-1 earlier this month to put on hold the data security provision of the rules. The provision that would require customers to ""opt in"" to allow your internet service provider to share personal information with marketers was still under review by the White House's Office of Management and Budget.

Is this a big deal?

Yes. According to a report published last year, Americans are more worried about their data privacy than they are about losing their main source of income. The rules the FCC adopted were the strictest set of regulations that had ever been imposed to protect consumer online privacy. Even though the rules only included broadband and wireless providers, and excluded internet companies like Google and Facebook, proponents saw it as a first step in giving consumers more control of their personal data online.

What's this mean for me?

Since the FCC's rules never actually went into effect, you won't notice much difference in how companies are protecting your privacy. But eventually, you'll see a lot more targeted advertising and creepy ads that follow you all over the internet. Your broadband provider, whether that's AT&T, Verizon or Comcast, will still be able to sell some information about you to advertisers, just as Google and Facebook can.

Broadband providers are already moving into the content business, and they're likely to get more aggressive in how the information is used and who gets to use it.

Is that a bad thing for me?

Not necessarily. Internet service providers may use advertising to subsidize the cost of your service. So in exchange for trying to sell you stuff, they may cut the price of your service or offer you free or special access to content.

What does that mean for my privacy on the internet?

You won't have much say how your personal information is used by your broadband provider or anyone else. But there will still be a cop on the privacy beat looking out for the most egregious violations of privacy.

Even without formal rules in place, the FCC is still in charge of protecting privacy for wireless and broadband customers. And it will continue to look at privacy concerns on a case-by-case basis. However, the agency will not be using the strict rules and standards it set in October. Instead, it will likely use a similar approach to what the Federal Trade Commission uses to keep tabs on companies like Facebook and Google.

This means that internet service providers will be able to sell your personal information to marketers without needing your consent. However, the agency can still investigate claims of privacy abuse by these companies.

The FCC has demonstrated that it can step in to protect consumers. In April 2015, after it passed net neutrality rules giving it jurisdiction over privacy, the agency fined AT&T $25 million for failing to protect customer information, including Social Security numbers.

Who supports these rules?

Supporters include consumer advocates like Free Press and Public Knowledge, and Democrats, such as Sens. Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Al Franken of Minnesota, as well as Tom Wheeler, the former FCC chairman who championed these rules. They say the FCC rules would provide better protections for consumers. The rules, they say, are justified because consumers have few choices when it comes to broadband.

Online giants including Google, Facebook, Netflix and Apple haven't been especially loud in their support, but the rules would have benefited them competitively, so they were happy about that.

Who wants to tear them down?

On the other side of the debate are the big cable and phone companies and Republicans such as Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. The two Republicans who were on the FCC when the rules passed also oppose the rules. Pai, who was a commissioner when the rules passed, became chairman of the FCC under the Trump administration.

Why have the rules been controversial?

Opponents of the rules think the FCC's stricter approach to privacy puts broadband and wireless companies at a disadvantage, especially with online advertisers. Google and Facebook, the giants of online advertising, are subject to looser requirements under the FTC. Critics want the FCC to adopt rules that are in line with the FTC's approach.

What's the difference between FCC and FTC approaches to privacy?

The main difference is in how consumers give consent to have their information shared. Under the FCC rules, consumers would have to opt in to have their personal information shared with marketers. The FTC model only requires that companies provide a way to opt out of having their personal information shared with third parties.

What's next?

Once Trump signs the legislation, the rules will no longer be on the books. And because the Congressional Review Act prohibits the FCC from adopting similar rules in the future, the agency won't be able to draft new rules to provide these protections.

In addition, it's possible that Congress or the FCC will undo net neutrality regulations and return broadband to its previous classification, which would put the FTC back in charge of broadband privacy.

Democrats say they will continue to fight for online consumer-privacy protections. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat, said he plans to ""introduce legislation that directs the FCC to reinstate strong broadband privacy rules.""

Of course, since the Democrats don't control Congress or the White House, it's unlikely they can get the legislation passed.

Can I do anything to keep my ISP from collecting and selling my info?

You can try to opt out of having your data collected and shared. But don't expect broadband companies to make it easy for you.

Your other option is to download VPN software from a company like AnchorFree. VPNs, or virtual private networks, provide an alternative route for your online traffic that is hidden from your broadband provider. However, wireless companies are still able to track your location. And the VPN technology can often result in slower access to applications or sites, which may frustrate users. There's also a chance that certain applications, like Netflix, will block your connection because it doesn't allow VPN access.

http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20048416-12.html,Amazon Cloud Drive and Cloud Player (review),"March,Pm,Donald Bell",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"There's been a lot of talk about storing our media in ""the cloud"" over the past few years, but not a lot of action.

We've seen start-ups such as mSpot and MP3tunes tackle the music locker idea while options like SugarSync and Dropbox lure users looking for more general file backup solutions. Still, no one yet has been able to push a cloud storage service into the mainstream. With Cloud Drive, Amazon.com is hoping to change that.

The online megastore's Cloud Drive online storage service starts with a free 5GB base plan that can be increased to 20GB, 50GB, 100GB, 200GB, 500GB, and 1,000GB, priced at $1 per gigabyte, per year (so that a 100GB plan costs $100 per year). For a limited time, customers who purchase an album from Amazon's MP3 store are automatically upgraded to a 20GB trial account for one year.

What do you get?

The promise of a product like Amazon's Cloud Drive is that you can upload all of the precious media files from all of your computers and devices (home, work, phone) to one common place, so that you're never stranded without access to your digital media.

Aside from Amazon's handy cross-platform uploader and downloader utilities and its browser-based tools for viewing, downloading, and streaming your stuff, Amazon is also throwing in a Cloud Player feature within the Amazon MP3 application for Android. Using the free app, you can stream all the music you have stored in the cloud, or download your tracks on the fly for offline playback.

How does it work?

Once you've chosen your plan on Amazon's site, you'll be prompted to download and install an MP3 Uploader tool that runs within the Mac- and PC-compatible Adobe Air platform (a separate download if you don't already have it). After Amazon's software is installed, it will run a quick scan of your drive, report on how many music files you have available to upload, and show you how much storage is available with your current plan.

If you don't have room for your whole collection, you can use the software to manually select which artists, songs, or playlists you'd like to upload.

After uploading, you can navigate through your music collection using Amazon's browser-based Cloud Player. Similar to the music locker interfaces we've seen from mSpot and MP3tunes, the Amazon Cloud Player allows you to sort your collection by song, artist, album, or genre by selecting from the intuitive sorting options in the left column. A listing of uploaded playlists is also displayed below the main sorting options. We were happy to see that the Amazon uploader tool was able to digest our iTunes playlists, including Smart Playlists and Genius Playlists.

A big play/pause button and track skip, shuffle, loop, and volume controls are lined up across the bottom of the player, proving easy, friendly controls for playback.

To get your music back down from the cloud and onto a computer, you have two options. One way is to manually select any Cloud Drive file or folder and click the download button located above the file list. If the file you're downloading is music, you may be prompted to download Amazon's Adobe Air-based MP3 Downloader app, although you probably already have this if you've downloaded music from Amazon before.

The second way to retrieve your music is to set it up automatically under the Cloud Player's settings menu. Here you'll find a check box that will direct the MP3 Downloader tool to automatically download any new music in your Cloud Drive to your computer. The setting is computer-specific, so it's possible to set things so that only your home computer will download new Cloud Drive music, leaving your work computer uncluttered, for example. It's a useful feature, and we're glad to see that Amazon included it.

Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't handle other types of files as elegantly as music. When you back out of the Cloud Player into the general Cloud Drive browser, you'll find folders for documents, pictures, and videos, in addition to music. Non-music files must be selected and uploaded through a browser pop-up window, instead of using the more elegant and automatic MP3 Uploader tool. Once uploaded, your files are organized generically as a hierarchical tree of files and folders. You have the option to copy, move, download, and delete these files--but that's it.

There are no options to share content, and no pretty photo views, and video playback is handled by your browser. Common cloud backup features such as folder monitoring and background uploading are also absent. In short, Amazon has a ways to go before Cloud Drive is a full-featured online backup solution.

Why is this important?

First and foremost, Cloud Drive is a free method for consolidating music collections that have been strewn across multiple computers and devices. There are similar products out there, but Amazon's scale, the breadth of its storage plans, and the popularity of its MP3 store will make Cloud Drive the service to beat in the music space.

From an industry perspective, the introduction of Cloud Drive and its ties into the Amazon MP3 store amount to a big competitive advantage over other music download stores, most notably Apple's iTunes store. Amazon is effectively guaranteeing a backup of your MP3 purchases at no cost, which is a big incentive to go with Amazon over Apple.

(Credit: Donald Bell/CNET)

What's missing?

As a music storage and management package, Amazon's Cloud Drive and Cloud Player combination is easy to use and easy to recommend. There are some holes in the music service, such as limited format support (strictly unprotected MP3 and AAC), the somewhat dry user interface, a reliance on the Adobe Air platform, and the lack of an iOS app. If and when Apple comes out with something similar, it will likely run within iTunes, dovetail with iOS devices such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch, and support Apple's lossless audio format.

The biggest disappointment is how Amazon handles storage of non-music files. There are dozens of services out there that are more adept at intelligently archiving and organizing photos, documents, and videos. The uptime reliability of Amazon's servers is nice, and the plan pricing is competitive, but services such as SugarSync and Dropbox are better tools when it comes to routinely backing up critical files and folders.

Final thoughts

For music fans, Amazon's Cloud Drive and Cloud Player get an unqualified thumbs-up from us. The price is right, the interface is simple, and if you're already a fan of Amazon and its MP3 store, then it's a slam dunk. If what you want to do is automatically back up files other than your music collection, there are better products and services for that out there.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-20068654-75/microsoft-limits-daily-approval-of-windows-phone-apps/,Microsoft limits daily approval of Windows Phone apps,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Lance Whitney/CNET

Microsoft is now restricting the number of Windows Phone apps that it will approve from a single developer to 20 per day.

In a blog posted yesterday, Microsoft said the new restriction is aimed at cutting down on ""bulk app publishing,"" a process through which developers can flood the Windows Phone Marketplace with hundreds of apps over the course of just a few days.

Though these apps may meet Microsoft's certification guidelines, the company is concerned that such apps can push other recently-published apps out of the ""What's New"" category, thereby degrading and ""reducing the diversity of the shopping experience"" for Windows Phone customers.

Microsoft is basing the 20-app limit on its own evaluation and feedback from users as well as developers. Developers can still submit more than 20 a day, but only 20 will be certified per day.

To further deal with bulk app developers, Microsoft said it's already removed certain apps from the Marketplace, giving those developers an opportunity to refine their apps in an attempt to cut down on the sheer quantity of them. The company has also offered to work with developers to help them better create fewer individual apps instead of producing large numbers with similar functionality.

The new policy goes into effect immediately, though Microsoft added that it's open to changing the limit based on the growth of the Marketplace and further feedback from customers and developers.",html
https://www.cnet.com/products/apple-iphone-6-plus/,Apple iPhone 6 Plus review:,,2014-09-16T18:01:00-07:00,"Editors' note: On September 7, 2016, Apple debuted the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and discontinued the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus remain available, however, and Apple has increased the storage capacity of the entry-level models to 32GB and lowered prices to $549 and $649, respectively. The full iPhone 6 Plus review, first published in September 2014 and updated in June 2015, follows.

In 2014, Apple forked its iPhone product line, simultaneously introducing the next generation of its flagship model -- the iPhone 6 -- and debuting its super-sized sibling, the iPhone 6 Plus. The iPhone 6 is an exceptional phone in nearly every way but for its middling battery life. The iPhone 6 Plus is also impressive; larger and thinner than other iPhone models, and with the capacity for far more endurance on a single charge than most comparably-sized and smaller competitors.

As great a phone as it is, the iPhone 6 Plus isn't for everybody. Its defining characteristic is its size, which occupies a nice middle ground between the 4-inch iPhone 5S and the 7.9-inch iPad Mini. While the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 is considerably more portable, the 6 Plus will hit the sweet spot for those who want a bigger display on their smartphone (and prefer iOS to Android).

And remember: a 5.5-inch screen may feel gigantic at first, but it may end up feeling just right in no time.

Design

Befitting its moniker, the 6 Plus is on the large side, measuring 6.22 inches high by 3.06 inches wide (158mm by 78mm). At 6.07 ounces (172 grams) it's just a touch lighter than the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 but noticeably thinner -- just 7.1mm in thickness, compared with the Note 4's 8.5mm.

Dimensions aside, the iPhone 6 Plus feels better in the hand than the Note. Like previous iPhones, it's made of matte aluminum, but where harsh lines and chamfered edges give the iPhone 5 a stark, industrial feel, the iPhone 6 Plus nestles more comfortably in your hand rather than cutting into it.

That noted, the rounded shape -- complete with glass that blends into the rounded edges -- provides a less distinctive appearance. That curved glass will be familiar to owners of Nokia Lumia devices, and the inset lines of plastic on the back are reminiscent of the HTC One . Though the iPhone 6 Plus looks and feels great, it lacks the unique styling of its predecessor.

CNET

Owners of earlier model iPhones will need to adjust to different button locations; the iPhone 6 Plus's power/lock button is located on the right side - a good thing, given how far one would need to reach if it were placed on the top. The volume buttons, wide and flat rather than round, are located on the left directly beneath the ring/silent toggle switch. The 3.5mm headphone jack sits at the bottom, as it does with the 5S, next to eight holes that allow sound from the (surprisingly powerful) internal speaker to escape.

Then, of course, there's the home button, front and center below the display, featuring Touch ID functionality, which allows you to unlock the phone quickly with a fingerprint. While this feature is no longer as novel as it was when it debuted, Touch ID remains quicker and more reliable than the fingerprint detection capabilities we've seen on other smartphones. And with iOS 8, you can use fingerprint access for a wide variety of apps beyond the lock screen and iTunes Store.

CNET

'Reachability'

To avoid any unfortunate thumb-straining incidents, Apple provides the ""Reachability"" feature: two quick taps on the Home button slide any content at the top of the display -- app icons, Safari's URL bar, whatever else is up there -- down to the bottom. (That's a double tap rather than a double press -- the latter of which opens up the app switching screen, as it does on earlier versions of iOS.) Though it's handy in theory, we did not find it particularly useful in practice.

For example, if you want to open a folder of icons on the top of the display, a double-tap brings that folder down. Tap on the folder and it opens, but then slides back up to the top again. You need to double-tap on the Home button again to bring it down a second time so that you can select an icon within. It's simply too much tapping to be of regular use, even for those with short thumbs, though it could be handy if you're standing on a bus or train and need your other hand to hang on.

CNET

Landscape mode

Another software tweak exclusive to the Plus is a special layout for some apps when the phone is held sideways in landscape mode. Mail and Messages give you an iPad-like view, with a list of messages on the left and their content on the right.

Pocketability

The size of your hands, and your ability to reach the corners of the device, will play a large part in determining whether the 6 Plus is a good fit for you. Another deciding factor will be whether it fits into your pockets. Unless your pants are of the cargo variety, you're probably going to want the iPhone 6 Plus in a back pocket when you're out and about.",html

Firefox Aurora 7 can be downloaded for Windows, Mac, and Linux, and includes changes that Mozilla said in a blog post announcing the release will result in 30 percent less memory use ""for many users.""

Another big memory usage change comes to the ""garbage collector"" process, which, when working properly, cleans out from your system memory browser processes that are no longer running in active tabs. This, too, is expected to result in better memory management. Telemetry infrastructure has been added to Firefox in this release, so it's easier for Mozilla developers to track how their changes affect the open-source browser.

Most of these relate to support for ""future-Web"" technologies, and the browser includes support for a Web timing specification to measure performance of a site as it's being used; the hardware acceleration function Azure Direct2D for HTML5 Canvas; and a more elegant way to display text that has spilled out of its boundaries on a page called CSS3 Text-Overflow: ellipsis.

This week Microsoft released Office 2016 for Windows and Mac (following Mac's Office 365 edition in July), and now comes the reckoning of what you get if you buy the suite outright, versus what you get if you opt for Office 365, which requires a monthly or annual fee. If you prefer to pay for Microsoft Office once and use it for several years before upgrading to a new version, you're going to find a lot of limitations.

No free trial

First, the most obvious absence is a free trial. Whereas Office 2013 could be tested for 60 days straight, no such option exists for the standalone version of Office 2016. If you want to give this new suite a trial run, Office 365 is now your only option.

No mobile or cross-platform

Microsoft does a lot to sweeten the Office 365 option. Only 365 throws in a version for tablets and mobile phones. The standalone suite's lack of mobile access to Word and Excel stings, given how much more popular mobile computing has become since the previous version of Office came out in early 2013. Similarly, if you want Windows and Mac versions of Office, you must buy them separately, whereas the 365 subscription includes both. With 365 you choose between a 1-user license for $70 per year (or $7 per month) or a 5-user license for $100 per year (or $10 per month). In addition to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, Office 365 unlocks Outlook, Publisher, and Access at every subscription level.

How to find the standalone Office suite and apps

If you want the full standalone suite, you'll have to hunt for it. If you go to the product comparison page on the Microsoft Office website, you are not shown the standalone versions that offer Outlook, Publisher, and Access; you'll see only the Home & Student SKU for $150. To see the other two versions, you have to scroll down to the Resources section and click the See Options link under Compare All Options. Then you'll find the $230 version that adds Outlook and the $400 edition that also gets you Publisher and Access. Even at these steep prices, the license is limited to one user.

However, you may be able to save money if you want just one or two of the Office apps. To find them, don't bother looking on Office.com; go to Microsoft's online store, where you'll find Word, Excel, and the rest priced at $110 each. So, for example, if you need Word 2016 and Access 2016 and nothing else, you can pay $220 instead of forking over $400 for the standalone version of Office 2016 that bundles Access. The individual programs are still limited to one user per license.

Also, be aware that the paid apps are downloads only; you cannot currently buy them on disc. However, if you need to reinstall the suite or one of its apps later on, you'll be able to retrieve the necessary files by logging into Office.com with your Microsoft account username and password. If you don't have an Microsoft account, Microsoft can help you create one the first time you install Office. If you have an account for OneDrive, Xbox Live, Skype, Hotmail, or MSN, then you already have a Microsoft account and can use that login.

Here are the direct links to the purchase pages for the downloadable versions of Office 2016's apps:

Skype and OneNote limits

Some exclusions or reductions are understandable. The standalone version does not give you 60 free minutes of Skype per month, and the bundled OneDrive storage (Microsoft's competitor to Google Drive and Dropbox) is reduced from 1TB to 15GB. These services cost money to operate, so it makes sense for Microsoft to charge a periodic fee for them.

Should you subscribe or go free?

Given Microsoft's stark limitations on the standalone license (particularly the lack of multi-user licenses), Office users may look to free options. If you can make do with streamlined, cut-down Office apps, Microsoft offers free Web apps on Office.com that have roughly the same amount of functionality as Google Docs. These apps are dependent upon a constant connection to the Internet, and the files created on Office.com are stored in your OneDrive account, which you can access from Office 365 and the standalone versions of Office 2016 and Office 2013.

You might also be tempted to switch to Google Docs or LibreOffice, free alternatives that have made great strides in recent months. Both can create and read documents that use Microsoft Office's file formats. Before you spend more money on Office, it's worth giving these apps a spin and testing their compatibility with your Office documents and spreadsheets.

SAN FRANCISCO -- They are classic ""frienemies,"" collaborating when the interest is mutual and going for the other's jugular when the opportunity presents itself. So it was that on Monday Apple made clear that it's willing to cut ties with Google if that's what it takes to move its own agenda forward.

Among the product and technology announcements made at its annual developer conference here, Apple said it is expanding its Siri voice assistant software, as well as offering a complete rewrite of its maps app. Apple also added deep integration to Facebook to its phones and tablets. If it all works out as Apple wants, the net effect will be to extend Apple's lead at Google's expense. Here's how:

Maps

Perhaps nowhere is this more apparent than in regard to the new version of Maps for iOS. Apple yanked Google maps from all its mobile devices, and took that function in house.

Apple

The results were striking. A new 3D feature lets users swoop around cities and see buildings using photography Apple captured on its own. Google demoed what was essentially the same thing in detail during a press conference last week, with a pledge to bring it to iOS later this year.

The move is just part of a larger effort by Apple to differentiate its mobile OS from Google's at a time when the two companies are at war with each other for the pockets, and pocketbooks, of consumers. That clash began on store shelves when the two companies started competing in the mobile-device arena. It has since spilled out into courtrooms, with Apple attacking Android device makers along with patents related to Android features.

Where this can really hurt Google is in the flow of information. Information about areas people are searching for and what types of information they want is absolute gold when it comes to product development and advertising. Apple happens to have its hands in both of those pots, and now it doesn't have to share data with a rival.

Apple is also doing something different by positioning its mapping app as a marketplace of sorts. During today's keynote, the company said it will feature location apps made by other companies right through the app -- though that simply could have been a concession to roadkill it made out of the other GPS apps for the platform.

Siri

The we-can-do-better-than-Google theme began almost immediately, with a demo of Siri that opened up the conference. The sassy voice assistant made cracks about Google and its products before the company's executives even took to the stage.

""Hey, any of you guys been working with ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich) or Jelly Bean?"" the software asked in a prerecorded video that started the show. ""Who's working up these code names? Ben & Jerry?""

Apple

Apple made it clear it wants to transform Siri into something far more than an iPhone app. That starts with Siri for Apple's third-generation iPad, and will extend to cars within the next 12 months. Several automakers, including BMW, General Motors, and Honda, have signed up and will integrate Siri into steering wheels. This competes more with the Microsoft Sync technology, which is built into some automobiles. But in the way Apple is currently demoing it, everything will run through your iPhone, something that competes more directly with Android's special car mode.

Put simply, Siri is becoming Apple's search engine. It may send users to Google or Microsoft's Bing for some queries, but the idea is the same: It's taking user queries and directing them toward something. Today that functionality expanded to new types of information, like movie times, restaurants, and sports. Arguably, those are three things users might have turned to Google for, and no longer have to. Other features, like being able to launch apps, were catch-ups to features Google has had on Android.

Fragmentation

Name-calling goes only so far, which is why Apple made an effort to point out that its strategy of selling a more limited group of iOS-capable hardware (the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch) resulted in more users staying up to date, compared with people using rival mobile devices.

""Almost all of our users are running iOS 5,"" Apple's senior vice president of iOS, Scott Forstall, told developers, while standing in front of a large pie chart. ""Now if you compare that to the competition, they released dairy product 4.0 about the same time we released iOS 5.""

That played well to the audience of developers for a good reason: with more users on the same OS, it makes developing easier. There's no reason to produce multiple versions of the same app, with only certain features available to specific users -- something Apple has harped on Google for in the past, specifically with tablet apps.

In March, for instance, Apple CEO Tim Cook slammed Android's tablet efforts, calling a number of third-party Android applications shoddy.

""It kind of looks like a blown-up smartphone app,"" Cook said, while pointing to an on-screen example of Twitter's Android app. ""Because that's exactly what it is.""

Today that message came back around in terms of the number of apps available to consumers, which now stands at 650,000 on the App Store, with 225,000 of those made for the iPad. And perhaps more importantly, the payout: Apple's paid out more than $5 billion to developers since launching the App Store, Cook said.

Facebook

Apple's move to integrate Facebook into iOS isn't a direct hit at Google, but it unites two companies against a common enemy. The new features let iOS 6 users post right to Facebook from within apps, as well as sync up their Facebook lives to their phone. Things like contacts and calendars get automatically ferried between the two companies.

Apple

Apple also integrated Facebook into iTunes and the App Store. This is more promotional than anything, but it's also a strong sign that besides Twitter, Facebook will be the only social network Apple is giving users to promote its content.

""We believe the biggest takeaway is that Apple is strengthening not only the interaction within its own ecosystem but also creating a consortium of powerful Web partners to offer an experience that largely falls outside of Google's walls,"" Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster said in a note to investors today. ""We believe this focus on integrating important Web partners continues to meaningfully differentiate iOS from Android.""

In other words, the real move here is in just how many places Facebook is present in iOS 6, and in the upcoming version of Apple's desktop OS. The idea is that if you want to share anything, you can do it basically from anywhere. For a company that was once determined to keep app developers within the confines of its mobile Web browser, it's arguably just as big to let others into similarly hallowed ground.

At this stage, Apple still prefers to talk around the hard edges. But make no mistake: Tweaking Google to get a few laughs out of the crowd hinted at the bigger stakes in this competition. For Apple, a roll of the dice is well worth the risk. In a race with Google to see who can get out the better technology first, Apple believes it has grabbed post position. Game on.",html

Back in March, Microsoft promised the world, and especially Windows Mobile 6 owners, a native Facebook application for Windows Mobile phones. On Thursday, Redmond delivered. OK, so Facebook for Windows Mobile 6 was forecast for April instead of May, but we're willing to overlook its tardiness because the app not only works quite well, but it also adds some unique and useful functionality tailored to this platform.

It's striking that Facebook on Windows Mobile is recognizable, but doesn't look like the spitting image of the site, unlike Facebook on BlackBerry, Palm, and iPhone, which retain the site's very strong look and feel. That said, it matters little. The core features are there--the news feed, status, and photo updates, notifications, and friend requests. Also your personal wall, info, and photos, your friends list, and so on.

It's noteworthy that the phone's form factor may affect how you navigate. On the tall, thin Samsung Omnia, flipping the screen horizontally showed the full width of the app, but not the depth. The vertical view condenses the navigation icons up top, but truncates the secondary navigation bar just below, so you'll need to scroll to the right to see the photo tab, for instance.

Here's one example that it's not Facebook as usual on these phones. Instead of following a link to update your status within the app window, you either press a soft key (from your profile page) or a menu item (from the Status Updates screen) to tell your circle what you're up to.

Facebook for Windows Mobile also includes a few mobile-only features that make use of the operating system's characteristics. As with Facebook on other mobile platforms, you're able to upload a photo from your album, or take a new one. You'll be able to do the same for video, assuming your phone has that capability. In addition, the app uses the Windows Mobile menu metaphor that pops up activities when you tap your finger or stylus to the touch screen. For instance, tapping a friend's status message produces a list of three options: view their profile, write on the wall, or leave a comment.

(Credit: CNET)

The best and most original new feature is the phone book, which neatly gathers the names and numbers of buddies who have populated their profiles with their digits. With this list, you can call, text, or send a message to their Facebook in-box. (Note: Texting didn't work with my Omnia during testing, but did work with a Windows Mobile 6 Palm Treo Pro.)

Somewhat similar address book tie-ins have been very recently implemented on Facebook for BlackBerry, but the goal was more to port Facebook photos to the address book and give users a quick way to start writing to a Facebook contact, rather than to give social networkers quick access to a secondary address book. I, for one, hadn't realized I had so many of my contacts' phone numbers at my fingertips. Now if only Microsoft or RIM could mash up their ideas to create a new record in the native address book for these Facebook contacts, and pull in their photos in the process.

(Credit: CNET)

Once again, it's interesting to note Facebook's strategy of collaborating with developers from Microsoft, as they have done with those at RIM, Palm, and others, to let the platform-providers roll out these apps themselves on the BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, and Palm. It makes sense--Facebook's team is relatively small, but demand for Facebook is globally high. Rather than wrestle with programming for separate platforms, Facebook can get Palm's engineering corps to work with Facebook, using APIs or other tools in the development arsenal.

As a result, these multiple versions of Facebook vary in their ancillary feature sets, but keep the marrow of the app the same--feeds, photos, and so on. The design of Microsoft's Facebook app isn't nearly as crisp or beguiling as is the iPhone's, for example, and it could use some work making tasks like searching for names from within the phone book much smoother. However, Microsoft rose to the occasion with the substance of this app, and the effort shows.",html

Pros

A professional-grade interface: Free programs and utilities often look kludgy and dated and have confusing or cryptic navigation. Avira, however, feels like software that you would ordinarily pay for. It almost looks like something built into the operating system, and you can navigate using either the left-hand pane or the drop-down menus along the top.

Lots of optional configuration: Avira works just fine out of the box, capable of running system scans without slowing down other tasks, like loading webpages or editing a document. But if you want, you can change settings like the number of days before Avira warns you that its definition file (basically, a book of virus mug shots) is out of date. You can also specify what types of compressed files you want to be scanned or ignored, ignore specific files or processes, target specific file extensions, and search for root kits before scanning. It's unusual to find this many options in a free antivirus app -- and you must have administrator privileges to change anything, so secondary accounts can't log in and tamper with it.

No hard sell: Unlike many free antivirus apps, Avira Antivirus Free is mostly content to run in the background and quietly do its thing. You'll get the occasional pop-up window, but it's not distracting.

Cons

SafeSearch Plus has issues: Avira offers the SafeSearch Plus browser add-on during installation. It puts a button in your browser that you click to enter a Web search, and the results are sanitized by Avira to reduce the chance of you being led to a malicious page. It looks very much like Google and even plugs into Google Maps, but the add-on will pop up a window urging you to change how your New Tab page works -- every single time you open a new tab. It also doesn't appear to work in Firefox -- the change never takes effect, and you just keep getting the pop up every time you open a new tab. It works fine in Chrome, but in this browser it also redirects you to its own search engine instead of Google when you use Chrome's address bar to search for things, which is a bit further than we'd like to go. Thankfully, you can skip installing SafeSearch Plus.

Not quite as good as a premium antivirus app: According to security software tests from AV-Test, one thing never changes: you get what you pay for. Avira Antivirus Free might be the all-around best antivirus app that you don't have to pay for, in terms of speed, quality of scanning, and usability, but paid programs from Kaspersky, Bitdefender, and McAfee consistently edge it out. You can get some of these for pretty cheap if you shop around. And there can be fringe benefits as well to paid software -- for example, your version of Norton is always the latest one as long as you have a subscription, and McAfee suites can now be used on an unlimited number of devices.

Bottom Line

If you're tight on cash, Avira Free is a compelling option, as long as you skip SafeSearch Plus during installation. But a little extra insurance can go a long way, so we'd prefer to stick to the big guns from the major vendors.",html

Facebook's annual developer conference gets its name from eight-hour hackathons in the company's early days. Though Facebook has grown from being just a social media site, it's still clearly focusing on helping its 1.6 billion users communicate.

Facebook Live Video

Facebook says that Live Video, its alternative to Periscope (iOS, Android) and Meerkat (iOS, Android), has already become a successful product, with more views and 10 times more comments than regular, nonstreaming videos. Facebook will continue to add features, such as a video tab where you can see top streams from around the world. To make it easier to create live video streams, Facebook announced Mevo, a live-event camera.

Instant Articles

Instant Articles is Facebook's format for fast-loading interactive stories. Facebook plans to work on making sure you get only the most relevant articles in your news feed. So Instant Articles will rely less on what your friends are reading and more on artificial intelligence examining photos and text to better understand what articles are about.

Messenger

With 20 billion messages sent each day, Facebook Messenger is one of the top messaging platforms. Facebook has already extended the app's abilities with mobile payments; now it's adding chatbots for other transactions. Search the 40 partner bots for customer service, commerce, and transportation help, and the bots can respond with texts, buttons, images, and calls to action. Zuckerberg bragged that if you want to order flowers from 1-800 Flowers, you'll never have to call again.

Oculus Rift

Oculus Rift already boasts hundreds of apps. Later this year, Facebook will release touch controllers to create another layer of immersion. Zuckerberg sees virtual reality's potential for deeper social interactions, because it enables you to feel like you're right there with another person.

You can also look forward to augmented-reality glasses that let you see digital objects on top of your actual environment. At the keynote, Zuckerberg imagined that someday, instead of displaying content on a TV, you'll share it using dollar apps from an augmented-reality app store.

Mozilla released the software Tuesday for Windows, Mac, and Linux, several days later than predicted earlier this month but close to a year later than Mozilla planned in 2008. A final version of Thunderbird 3 is expected not long after the release candidate.

Thunderbird 3 has been years time in the making. For its next versions, the Mozilla Messaging group hopes to release new versions more frequently, said Mozilla Messaging programmer Dan Mosedale.

""Part of the plan for Thunderbird is to move our development process in a more agile direction...Rather than having super long releases, we'd like to release significantly more frequently than we have historically done,"" said a draft Mozilla proposal for what to do in the post-Thunderbird 3 era Mosedale posted. He proposed major Thunderbird releases every four to six months, starting with version 3.1, and also laid out some ideas for Thunderbird after version 3.1.

Thunderbird 3.0 adds a variety of features, according to Mozilla and the Thunderbird 3 RC1 release notes:

 A more elaborate search option to locate specific messages. People can employ a variety of methods to sift the wheat from the chaff.

 An e-mail archive a la Google's Gmail. Rather than filing every message in a folder, an organizational technique that can be hard to maintain with high volumes of messages, people can move them out of the inbox into the archive where search can find them later.

 A streamlined interface that cleans up the toolbar and moves some of its functions to the frame around e-mail messages.

 A new plug-in system designed to be easier to use to replicate some of the success of the Firefox browser. The browser, by the way, is built in so plug-ins can use it.

 A tabbed interface that can reduce clutter of e-mails, e-mail folders, and other tasks. A tab can, for example, house a version of Yahoo's online calendar.

 An easier process to set up new e-mail accounts. The software has preset settings for several e-mail services.

 ""Smart folders"" that can be customized in a variety of ways. For example, users with multiple e-mail accounts can create a smart folder that provides a unified inbox for all the accounts.

 An easier way to add people to the address book by clicking a star icon next to the sender's name.

Flash is widely used to bring streaming video, interactive graphics, and games to browsers; AIR, with Flash built in, is a foundation for other desktop applications. Both are instrumental to Adobe's effort to stay ahead of the gradually broadening feature set of HTML and related Web standards.

Notable Flash Player 10.1 is support for not just Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux computers, but also a variety of smartphones, though that support isn't yet built in. What is available is hardware-based decoding of the popular H.264 video format, which Adobe said improves performance and saves battery life. It also supports HTTP streaming linked with Adobe's content protection technology.

A version of Flash Player 10.1 for Palm Pre smartphones is expected later this year, Adobe said, and the final version for all systems is due in the first half of 2010.

AIR 2.0, which includes Flash Player 10.1, brings tighter integration with desktop computers. For example, it can communicate with some USB storage devices, monitor multitouch user interfaces, tap into microphone audio data, render Web pages using HTML5 and CSS version 3, and use UDP networking useful for in-game chat.

The final version of AIR 2 also is due in the first half of 2010, Adobe has said.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20000784-264.html,What's Google planning for Chrome 5?,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"After a year and a half, Chrome has come a long way toward matching the features of better-established browsers. Now, with version 5 coming together, a lot of Google's work focuses on advancing the state of the browser art.

The new Chrome 5 is available in beta now for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, not that most Chrome users will ever have to know the version number if Google has anything to do with it. Chrome versions are called ""milestones""--fleeting waypoints along an unfinished journey to a better browser. But what exactly will moving into the rear-view mirror once Chrome 5 is finished?

In short, a lot. Chrome fans may be dissatisfied with the speed with which their favorite features are arriving--print preview, for example, still seems distant, and Mac OS X and Linux users still have only a beta version of the browser to work with--but Google's pace of Chrome development is fast. Here are some highlights of what's coming in Chrome 5.

Geolocation

First up, Chrome will get geolocation, one of the better-settled elements of HTML5, the revised Hypertext Markup Language standard for Web page still under development. Geolocation lets the browser, if given the user's permission, inform a Web site of the user's location. That feature is handy for placing people on a map, finding nearby services or contacts, adjusting features on a Web site that may vary geographically, and simply telling a global Web site what the best server is for the user.

Actually obtaining the location is tricky. There are broad clues based on a user's Internet Protocol (IP) address, but Google (along with rival Skyhook) supplements this data with signals from radio signals from wireless networks and mobile phone networks. And, of course, some devices, mostly mobile phones, have GPS support.

Windows 7 features

Next on the list is support for a Windows 7 feature called Aero Peek, which pops up thumbnail images of open browser tabs when the user hovers the mouse pointer over the Chrome icon in the task bar. Internet Explorer supports this technology, unsurprisingly.

However, as Aero Peek support arrived in Chrome developer preview editions, the tenor of comments on the issue tracker has changed from ""Hurry up! Other browsers have this!"" to ""Make the pain stop! Give us an off switch!"" That's because many people have dozens of tabs open at once, at which point the feature can be messy and unhelpful. Chrome Aero Peek adjustments are under way.

Another Windows 7 feature, Jump Lists that provide a menu of actions people can take when clicking on the Chrome menu item, also comes with Chrome 5.

Extensions

It took Google longer than expected to build the major feature of Chrome 4, the ability to accommodate extensions that let others customize the browser's features. The integration was tough enough that a Mac version of the technology never made it out in a 4.x beta version. With Chrome 5, all three operating systems Google supports get extensions.

And extensions will change in Chrome 5. With some new browser interfaces, programmers will be able to expand what extensions can do. For example, history API will grant an extension access to a user's browsing history record; several others are possibilities but not slated for Chrome 5.

One feature Windows users got with a Chrome 4.1 version that never arrived for Mac and Linux users is an auto-translate pop-up that appears when Google detects a page written in a different language. Chrome 5 brings that to Mac and Linux.

Syncing

These days, people often use browsers from more than one computer and on mobile phones. To help smooth the experience, Chrome 5 is getting wider synchronization abilities beyond the bookmark sync that arrived in Chrome 4.

Coming in Chrome 5 should be sync for themes, autofill entries, and passwords. However, apparently pushed back to Milestone 6 is even more sync: extensions, open tabs, and Web addresses that have been typed into the browser.

For those who hate filling out forms, Chrome 5 gets an autofill feature that can remember names, addresses, phone numbers, and other personal details that often must be typed over and over again. That could placate people who like the feature in Google Toolbar, which doesn't work in Chrome.

Built-in Flash

Google also is working on a feature no other browser maker has added, a built-in version of Adobe Systems' Flash Player. Google is among the most aggressive advocates of programming technologies including HTML5, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) that ease Web page formatting, and JavaScript that runs Web-based programs, and those technologies collectively are a competitive threat to Flash. However, Flash is widespread on the Web today, and Google has taken a pragmatic stance toward including Flash.

Specifically, Chrome includes the next beta version of Flash Player, 10.1, which is due to be completed this quarter. And as with Chrome overall, Google will by default automatically update it without the user taking any action. That could be helpful given recent severe vulnerabilities in Flash, though some object to the idea of invisible updates. Google sees Chrome like Web sites, though: something that's constantly changed; people don't get a choice when they upgrade to the latest Google search algorithm.

And apparently, it's not just Flash. PDF support also is arriving as an internal plug-in that ships with the browser, the unofficial Google Operating System blog discovered.

WebGL

Google is working on other programming foundations, too. It's a supporter of the draft WebGL standard started by Mozilla and the Khronos Group, the latter the standards group that oversees the OpenGL graphics interface on which WebGL is based. WebGL permits sophisticated, low-level, hardware-acclerated 3D graphics from a Web application, a feature some hope will lead to elaborate interfaces and better online gaming.

Chrome 4 had a version of WebGL built in, but to use it, people had to disable a security feature called the sandbox that confines computing processes to keep them from running amok. Chrome 5, though, will likely get WebGL support within the sandbox, making it practical for people to try.

Don't expect whirling cubes and first-person shooters in a couple months, though. Even though OpenGL is familiar to many programmers, it's an unknown quantity to many Web programmers.

Another programming change is support for Native Client, Google technology to boost browser-based applications with security-scrubbed software modules that can run at the speed enjoyed by native software on a computer's ordinary operating system. Native Client support is a priority for Chrome 5 and works for 32-bit software running on Mac, Linux, and Windows computers. However, some 64-bit support is tripped up by an issue for 64-bit Windows that didn't get done in time for Chrome's milestone 5.

Users will get some new controls in Chrome as well. Conveniently for Flash haters irked that Flash will be built in, Chrome will have an ability to suppress its use, for example through use of a ""chrome://plugins"" address.",html

http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20079827-264/redesign-set-to-make-firefox-more-responsive/,Redesign set to make Firefox more responsive,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Mozilla has begun turning the Firefox crank faster with a rapid-release development cycle. So what's in store now that we can expect a new version every six weeks?

A lot, including 64-bit support on Windows and a plan to reduce the open-source browser's memory usage. But the most far-reaching change probably is a project called Electrolysis that splits Firefox into multiple somewhat-independent processes.

Electrolysis holds the potential to improve responsiveness, smooth graphics performance, take better advantage of multicore processors, and tighten security. Mozilla already added one Electrolysis element to Firefox 3.6--the separation of plug-ins to their own patch of memory--but now programmers are spinning up the project again to tackle more.

It took a little while, but there's no doubt now that the Firefox team has woken up to the newly competitive browser market. Firefox, once the obvious alternative to pokey Internet Explorer, now must reckon with Chrome's fast rise, Safari leading the mobile-browsing charge, and IE's restored focus. Mozilla has responded with the rapid-release development cycle that produces a new Firefox every six weeks.

One goal of the faster cycle is to bring new features to market sooner. Rather than waiting more than a year for a major upgrade, new ideas can arrive as soon as they've made it through the testing levels of nightly builds, the rough Aurora version, and the more polished beta.

Collect the garbage

Chris Blizzard, Mozilla's director of Web platform, didn't detail a schedule for new Electrolysis features in a blog post today about the technology. But he did say work is back on the front burner.

A key improvement from the work will be separating the user-interface process from the part of Firefox that handles the contents of browser tabs. The expectation is a snappier browser, Blizzard said:

What we're really talking about with multi-process performance is responsiveness:  How long does it take for a mouse click to be recognized?  When you resize the window does it feel smooth?  Does the browser mysteriously pause from time to time?  Are animations smooth, without pauses?

Some of this should get better because Firefox will better handle a process called garbage collection in which areas of memory that had previously been used are reclaimed for use again. Garbage collection can cause a program to pause, especially a large Web app such as Facebook or Gmail, Blizzard said.

Another benefit of Electrolysis is that separate memory processes can cut down on security problems because it's harder for a malicious process to tamper with memory. And it's naturally better-suited to the multicore processors that dominate the PC market today and that have begun arriving on mobile phones and tablets, too.

Splitting up processes into separate domains, though, isn't without its downsides, too. One big one: memory usage can increase. And it complicates some matters. For example, if each tab has its own patch of memory, it can be harder to share cached graphics.

Memory work

In the nearer term, Firefox should be cutting back its memory consumption through a project called MemShrink. Some fruits of this project should arrive with Firefox 7, set for release in September.

Firefox 7 memory use could drop 30 percent, Mozilla hopes. But it's not easy.

Some big changes this week had to be undone because of crashes and other problems, said Nicholas Nethercote, who writes about the MemShrink project.

Another change in the works for Firefox is better 64-bit support. The automated build system, a collection of machines that runs tests on new versions of the browser, is being adapted for 64-bit versions of the browser.

Release engineer Armen Zambrano Gasparnian, who took early steps for 64-bit Firefox support last year, is on the case again.

""We now have a small set of Windows 2008 64-bit slaves ready to be put in our production systems that can generate the 64-bit version of Mozilla Firefox,"" he said in a blog post this week. He's been filing bug reports as a result.

""This is all preparatory work to fully support Windows 64-bit as a tier-one platform,"" Gasparnian said. Tier-one systems are the high priorities for Mozilla; Android is the newest example.

The 64-bit transition began years ago with processors; Mac OS X has already made the jump, and it's very common in the Windows world now, too. The chief advantage is support for much more memory, though there are some performance improvements as well.

One of the big obstacles to a 64-bit browser was that plug-ins such as Adobe Systems' widely used Flash Player also must be 64-bit in order to work. That'll be the case in coming months, though: Adobe has just released a beta version of Flash 11 with 64-bit support.",html

Saturday is the 30th anniversary of the release of Pac-Man, and to commemorate the occasion, Google is rolling out its first-ever truly interactive and playable home page logo, a fully-functional version of the iconic 1980s video game.

For years, Google has produced its so-called doodles for all kinds of holidays and special occasions, from Valentine's Day to the Fourth of July to Mother's Day and many others. In each case, the Google Doodle team works on a special logo that appears on the search engine's home page.

But a few months ago, when the team discovered that May 22 would be the 30th anniversary of the release of Pac-Man in Japan--it was actually called Puck Man, but that name was rejected in the United States because of the propensity of the ""P"" to chip and look like an ""F""--they knew they had to do something extra special.

""When we became aware of the...anniversary,"" said Ryan Germick, a member of the Google Doodle team, ""we thought it would be awesome to create not only something that references Pac-Man on the home page, but also something playable.""

Until now, the most interactive of the logos had been one last Halloween that users could click to see more candy, and another for Isaac Newton's birthday that dropped apples. But for the Pac-Man celebration (see video below), Google has pulled out all the stops and has built, from scratch, a fully-playable version of the game, complete with 255 levels and re-created (but authentic) sounds and graphics. And unlike most of the special logos, which disappear off the home page--but are available in perpetuity in the archives--when the day is over, the Pac-Man doodle will stay up for 48 hours.

Now Playing: Watch this: Google's Pac-Man doodle

According to Germick, the company worked with Pac-Man's publisher, Namco Bandai, to make the project as realistic as possible. Yet the Google team, with the inspirational lead of Marcin Wichary, a Google senior user experience designer, built their version of the game from the ground up using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

""We are very excited about the Google doodle project,"" Namco Bandai President and CEO Kenji Hisatsune told CNET by e-mail. ""With this being the first time Google has ever included sound or made a doodle playable demonstrates just how big of an impact Pac-Man has made. ""

And in the end, Wichary made a ""picture-perfect"" version of the game, Germick said. Except for one thing, of course. Being a Google home page logo, it had to have the word ""Google"" in its design, so Wichary, Germick and their colleagues built their version of Pac-Man so that it had the search engine's name in the middle of the iconic board.

Growing up with games

For Wichary, who grew up in Poland, arcade video games were in his blood. His father was a game technician who used to take him around to arcades and let him see how the various machines worked. From those humble beginnings came a lifetime of interest in games and, now, the motivation and passion to make the Pac-Man project be as faithful as possible to the original game.

That commitment to authenticity extended, Wichary explained, to some of Pac-Man's little quirks. For example, though many people would never have experienced this, the original arcade game had a bug that resulted in anyone making it past the 255th level hitting what came to be called the ""kill screen,"" where the machine essentially crashed. Google made sure to build that experience into their game.

Similarly, after completing some levels of Pac-Man, a player would sit through brief animations, which came to be known as ""coffee breaks,"" since it provided enough time to stretch one's fingers and, perhaps, grab a cup of coffee. That, too, has been built into the Google version.

And the team was so focused on making their version true to the original that they even included some of the smallest touches possible, things that only the most serious Pac-Man players would know about. Wichary said those include things like the fact that in the original game, the ghosts would give the slightest hint of which direction they were going to turn by moving their eyes that way. That was included in the Google version, as was a peculiarity that allowed Pac-Man to cut corners by a couple of pixels while the ghosts had to turn them at full right angles.

In addition, Wichary pointed out that the original game was ""deterministic,"" meaning that players could memorize and develop winning patterns. Google, too, built that into its version, meaning that those who put some serious time into the game now will be able to make a lot of headway by figuring out the patterns that work best.

""Google spent a lot of man-hours making sure the simple things that make Pac-Man were included,"" Hisatsune said, referencing the coffee break and 255th-level bug.

Germick explained that at Google, the Doodle team is always looking for ways to make the Google home page a ""fun place to be,"" so once the team came up with the idea for the Pac-Man project, ""it didn't take a lot of selling internally. Once people saw it, they were like, 'Awesome.'""

Putting together the Google version of Pac-Man took a couple of months, but Wichary said it would be hard to estimate how much time they actually put into the project because ""I enjoyed it so much. It was a throwback to my childhood.""

Indeed, Wichary said that one of his biggest reasons for getting involved in this effort was to help bring other people back to their own childhoods.

I'm feeling lucky

On a normal day, Google's home page features two simple buttons: one for a full keyword-specific search and the famous ""I'm feeling lucky"" choice, which picks one result based on a keyword.

For the Pac-Man project, the team has converted the ""I'm feeling lucky"" button into an ""Insert coin"" slot, reminiscent of the place where countless kids have pumped billions of quarters over the years.

Fittingly, the team decided that if they were going to make their Pac-Man game authentic, they would need to make it playable by two people at once. So where a single player will, so to speak, insert a single coin, clicking twice sets up a two-player game. In that case, one player will be Pac-Man and the other will be Ms. Pac-Man, and both will be playing on the same board at the same time, using a single keyboard.

In the end, the Google team put a lot of focus into re-building what is one of the best-known and recognized games of all time. For a game that's 30 years old, it holds up remarkably well over time, and still has a hold on popular culture.

And as something that is still a hit so many years later, it made perfect sense to the Google team to break new ground with its approach to the Pac-Man project. Yet, rather than just getting code from Namco, they decided to do things the Google way.

""I wanted to do the same thing we do with everything else at Google,"" Wichary said, ""which is use modern Web technologies. So we built it from the ground up.""",html
https://www.cnet.com/products/windows-8-1-update/,"Windows 8.1 Update Release Date, Price and Specs",,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"The latest update to Windows 8 will be available on April 8 and brings much-needed tweaks for desktop users, restoring some of the features Windows users have been missing since the Metro interface first launched.

First and foremost, the OS now detects whether you're using a tablet or desktop and mouse setup, and delivers the best experience for your device. This means that upon launch, if you're on a desktop computer, the OS will boot straight to the desktop, and on a tablet, you'll get the touchable tiles of Microsoft's modern interface. But don't worry if you prefer the way Windows currently behaves; you still have the option to choose your startup preferences in the settings.

Microsoft also made some changes with full-screen apps making them a lot more intuitive for desktop users and more in line with the history of the Windows OS. Full screen apps now (once again) have a title bar at the top, with the X in the upper right so you can quit out of an app easily with a click of your mouse. You also can pin Modern apps to the taskbar alongside your other pinned apps for a more unified experience.

With the modern interface out of the way on your desktop, it makes sense that Microsoft would find a way to make the Windows Store more accessible. Now, with this latest update, the Windows Store is automatically pinned to the taskbar on your desktop.

One of the biggest complaints about Windows 8 was the loss of the Start Button as we knew it in previous versions of Windows, and we're still not going to get a fix in this update, but there's some good news. As we know, Windows 8.1 brought back the Start Button for some functions, but still didn't offer many of the most used features in older Windows versions. Microsoft announced that a future update will give us a mash up of both the traditional Start Button view and the live tiles. So, with a click you will be able to get recently opened apps, your documents folder, and other common options found in older versions of the Start Menu, but on the right, you'll get the live tiles from the modern interface. It seems like a good compromise between the two, and I think it's the setup most people have been asking for.

http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20005466-264.html,WebM and Google's Web-video plan (FAQ),,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Google, trying step by step to rebuild everything in the computing industry from Internet protocols to cloud-computing services, began a new project called WebM on Wednesday that seeks to begin a new chapter in Web video.

Even after Google's high-profile WebM announcement at its Google I/O conference, there's plenty of confusion, and some questions concerning the technology can't be answered yet. Here, however, is our attempt to demystify WebM and its effects.

WebM is a codec--but what's a codec?

A codec is technology to encode and decode video or audio data. They're used to convert the high-quality source material of a movie, for example, into compressed form that's more easily transmitted over the Internet or stored on a Blu-ray disc. Then they're used to convert that compressed data into something that people can watch or listen to again. The prevailing video codec today is called H.264, aka AVC, and for audio, it's MP3. There are many others, however, including the AAC technology Apple uses for audio in iTunes and iPods, the Xiph.Org Foundation's Ogg Vorbis audio codec and Ogg Theora video codec. Codecs can run in hardware or software, but hardware acceleration is particularly useful when trying to decode video quickly enough to handle high-resolution displays or efficiently enough to preserve mobile-phone battery power.

Where does WebM fit in?

WebM combines the Ogg Vorbis audio codec with the VP8 video codec Google obtained through its February 2010 acquisition of On2 Technologies for $133.9 million. On2 has a long history in codecs: Its earlier VP3 technology formed the foundation of Ogg Theora, and its VP6 was widely used in video streaming on the Web by virtue of its inclusion in Adobe Systems' Flash Player. VP8 had only been under development until this week, but now Google has issued the specification for the technology, source code and a software developer kit to let programmers use it, and a collection of partners who endorsed it in varying degrees. In contrast to how On2 handled its codecs and to how an industry group called MPEG LA licenses patents for using H.264, Google released WebM as a royalty-free technology. That means among other things that nobody will have to pay for using it and that open-source software projects can incorporate it directly.

Hooray! Free codecs for everyone! Who could possibly be unhappy about this?

The 26 companies and organizations that have contributed to the pool of H.264 patents. Among them: Microsoft, LG Electronics, Panasonic, Philips Electronics, Samsung, Sharp, Sony, and Toshiba. Apple holds a single patent in the pool, too. It's not cheap to research video technology, and it's not cheap to license it, either. For example, even though Microsoft holds 73 patents in the H.264 pool, the company pays twice as much for its rights to ship H.264 support in Windows 7 as it receives back from MPEG LA for its share of the rights.

What's MPEG LA doing about it?

At a minimum, it's raising doubts about whether VP8 infringes video patents, and maybe more. Group spokesman Tom O'Reilly won't comment about whether VP8 infringes any H.264 patents, but he did say Thursday that MPEG LA is considering a new patent pool that would license any patents used in VP8 technology: ""Although we assume virtually all codecs are based on patented technology, the AVC/H.264 License we offer is limited to providing coverage for the use of AVC/H.264."" Added MPEG LA Chief Executive Larry Horn, ""Google has the right to disclaim royalties for its own technologies, if any, but it doesn't have the right to disclaim them without appropriate permissions for technologies owned by others, or otherwise contribute to the infringement of those technologies.""

The MPEG LA might offer a license for any patented technology in VP8. ""In view of the marketplace uncertainties regarding patent licensing needs for such technologies, there have been expressions of interest from the market urging us to facilitate formation of licenses that would address the market's need for a convenient one-stop marketplace alternative to negotiating separate licenses with individual patent holders in accessing essential patent rights for VP8 as well as other codecs, and we are looking into the prospects of doing so,"" Horn told All Things Digital.

It's not certain, but this could be the patent effort Apple CEO Steve Jobs apparently discussed in an April e-mail to a Free Software Foundation Europe member, saying, ""A patent pool is being assembled to go after Theora and other 'open source' codecs now. Unfortunately, just because something is open source, it doesn't mean or guarantee that it doesn't infringe on others' patents.""

So what happens next with VP8, WebM, and intellectual property?

It's not clear, but Google had to have carefully considered these patent concerns before releasing VP8, and Google has both the deep pockets and the motive to duke it out in court. Of course, if a patent infringement suit is filed, Google might not necessarily be the target.

One observer with some history in the area is more sanguine: Monty Montgomery, who worked on the Ogg Vorbis codec. ""The threats in the press recently aren't any different than they have been for the past 10 years. Lots of barking, no bite yet,"" he said. ""The howling from MPEG was much louder when Vorbis first appeared in 2000.""

Especially given the risks, why would Google buy something for $133.9 million then give it away for free?

Google is unusually high-minded and principled sometimes, but there's usually a profit motive involved in its actions, too, and VP8 and WebM are no exception. Google is working on many fronts to make the Web more actively used and a more powerful foundation for new uses. That, in turn, leads to more searching at Google and more search-ad revenue, and it can increase the utility and popularity of services such as Google Apps, Google Maps, and Google Buzz. But licensing requirements impose barriers to the growth of the Web--leaving aside the open-source difficulties, Firefox backer Mozilla would have to pay $5 million for an H.264 patent license, for instance. Imagine a company making phones designed to watch streaming YouTube videos or cameras designed to upload directly to YouTube. That company must pay royalties to use H.264, adding to the cost of the devices and limiting their sales to a mainstream market. Today a lot of video content still is delivered through traditional cable TV networks, but the more powerful the Web is at handling video, the more powerful Google is in the media technology realm.

This all sounds very theoretical. When will the rubber hit the road?

It's there already. Google assembled a lot of partners in the media and technology world to endorse VP8 and WebM, a crucial step and support is essential for such a complicated technology whose success depends on adoption across several industries. Logitech will use VP8 in its video chat service. Qualcomm, a power in the mobile phone market, will ""collaborate with On2/Google's engineering teams to support VP8 codec on our mobile platforms and deliver a rich video experience on Qualcomm-powered mobile devices."" Competitor Texas Instruments said, ""With access to the VP8 code, our OMAP 4 platform delivers high-resolution VP8 decode at the low power levels that mobile architectures demand."" And Broadcom: ""The WebM multimedia format is currently in development and expected to be available to VideoCore [processor] customers in Q3 2010. Broadcom worked with Google during the definition phase of the VP8 video codec included in WebM, reviewing the architecture's suitability for mobile applications."" Last, another chipmaker: ""MIPS Technologies will work with its partners and licensees to ensure fully optimized hardware/software support for VP8.""

Also on board are companies such as Sorenson Media that offer encoding technology for those who want to deliver WebM streams. But there's work yet to do: Graphics chip leaders Nvidia and AMD didn't commit to endorsing the technology, and Intel didn't even endorse it, despite its prominent placement in the Google TV initiative.

So how do you try WebM?

Today, the easiest way is downloading a rough developer-oriented test version of two browsers that will have support built-in: Firefox and Opera. Programmers have been working to add support for some time, but only made the changes public after Google's announcement. The open-source project behind Google Chrome, Chromium, has been updated with WebM support, but it'll take until May 24 for it to sift into the developer channel of the Chrome browser for convenient testing. Apple has been mum about its VP8 and WebM plans, but it's a big booster of H.264. Microsoft, another H.264 fan, has said its future IE9 will support VP8 if somebody takes the trouble of installing software to enable it.

Of course, you'll need some video to watch, too, and here the obvious destination is the HTML5 version of YouTube, where Google is testing support for the new video support built directly into Web pages. All videos uploaded to YouTube with 720p resolution or better will be encoded with WebM. Google just added Firefox and Opera to its supported browser list by virtue of WebM, but the company has only just begun transcoding video into the format, so there isn't an entire parallel-universe version of the video site available yet with the new codec.

Wait--I've been watching video on the Web for years. What's so new and experimental about it?

Most video on the Web today, including what's shown at Vimeo, YouTube, and Hulu, is actually delivered with Adobe's Flash Player plug-in. But many in the browser world don't like plug-ins when video could theoretically be delivered seamlessly within a Web page, the way JPEG images are, for example. Plug-in-based content often is a separate island within a Web page, and plug-ins come with memory and security issues as well. Consequently the groups behind the development of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) standard for Web pages are working on HTML5, an update that features support for built-in video.

Nice idea, but a big problem: the divided loyalties between the H.264 fans, notably Apple and now Microsoft, and the Ogg Theora fans, Opera and Mozilla, and with Google not interested in moving YouTube to Ogg Theora. With no agreement, HTML5 editor Ian Hickson let the video support go ahead with no codec specified.

So if VP8 is a more competitive alternative to H.264 than Ogg Theora was, will the Web standards group settle on a choice?

Conceivably, but not likely anytime soon. Two groups oversee HTML: The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Here's what Philippe Le Hegaret, leader of Web video work at the W3C, had to say: ""WebM/VP8 has the potential of providing a solution for the baseline video format of HTML5. In order to be seriously considered by the W3C HTML Working Group, the specification would need to go through a standards group and be developed under RF [royalty-free] licensing participation terms. W3C remains interested in having a video format for HTML5 that is compatible with the W3C Royalty-Free Patent Policy.""

Added HTML5 editor Hickson, ""What the spec says will depend entirely on what implementations (in particular browser vendors) decide to support."" That poses something of a chicken-and-egg problem, though: Microsoft has said it's ""all in"" with HTML5 support, implying that it would grow more enthusiastic about WebM if it became an official part of HTML5, but inclusion in the specification is at least somewhat contingent on browser support.

So at least for the near term, Web developers will have to deal with multiple codecs if they want to supply video through HTML5. Having WebM available, though, does advance the state of the art and make HTML5 video more palatable to those who had philosophical and practical objections to H.264.

So if HTML5 video has a stronger future, Flash is doomed, right?

Guess again. To Adobe, VP8 is just another codec, and indeed the company is embracing it. ""We're going to put VP8 inside Flash Player, and we are going to distribute VP8 to over a billion people in less than a year of its release. We're going to really help push out the VP8 codec,"" said Chief Technology Officer Kevin Lynch at the Google show. In addition to Adobe's strategic decision to sell tools for both Flash and HTML development, Adobe offers other reasons a Web developer might want to stick with Flash for now, including digital rights management protection of video streams. Some are convinced by Flash's merits--including one major video site, Hulu.

Released today by Symantec, Norton Internet Security 2012 beta (download) and Norton AntiVirus 2012 beta (download) also include a new start-up manager that debuted earlier this year in Norton 360, changes to Symantec's SONAR technology, and a new autofix feature for curing installation woes quickly.

The changes are not ground-breaking, but do appear to be able to keep Norton on top of its game. The Chrome support is a long-request feature for the world's third-most popular browser, and extends Norton Safe Web toolbar features such as search result evaluation, link scanning, and Norton's ID Safe to Chrome users.

The two engine changes in the Norton 2012 betas aren't exposed in any new interface modules, yet they are important. Insight 3.0, and its component Download Insight 2.0 feature, have been improved. As mentioned above, Download Insight now looks at downloaded files for security and stability. It won't stop you from downloading a file that's known to cause instability, but it will warn you and provide an option to stop the download.

This is a fairly well-designed feature, and can tell the difference between operating systems. This means that if a file is known to be stable on Windows 7 but unstable on Windows XP, only Windows XP users will see the warning.

Meanwhile, improvements in SONAR 4.0 include upgraded behavioral protection, which monitors running programs for suspicious behavior and will stop them if it detects any. One of the bigger changes in SONAR is that it now scores DLL file separately, allowing for more nuanced detection.

There have been some interface tweaks in the betas, adding bright green to a formerly yellow-and-black interface. While not a major redesign, the green does serve to better highlight key features, such as your security status. Norton's online storage vault also catches up to the competition this year, integrating a cloud sync feature, and the Norton Power Eraser for last-ditch fixes has been integrated with the Norton bootable recovery tool, so you won't have to download them separately.

While CNET Labs won't benchmark the Norton 2012 betas until the final versions are released, Symantec itself says that it is seeing substantial, double-digit benchmarking improvements over 2011's strong times.

Seemingly random names are embossed on the interior glass walls of the Avast offices and conference rooms in its Prague headquarters, and the June morning light illuminates them from behind. Written in black, these names and the orange-colored names of cities below them are, in fact, the forum nicknames of the people who use Avast and the cities they originate from. It appears there are Avast users on every continent, and that, said the company's CEO Vincent Steckler, is by design.

""Two-thirds of new users come from personal recommendations,"" he said. ""Trying to get 35 million users from direct marketing is nearly impossible, so we have to rely on the community."" Originally from the United States but living in Prague since he took over as Avast's chief officer in July 2009, Steckler is a numbers man. He touts the raw numbers of Avast's achievements with a pride that most parents reserve for a straight-A report card from their kids.

He gleefully told CNET that Avast can boast 29 countries with at least 1 million active users each. He pointed to Brazil having just passed France as the country with the most Avast active users, both with 12 percent. The United States is in third with 8 percent, but that Americans lead with the most Avast paid-upgrade installs. Five percent of its actives are in Russia, which Steckler said puts the country fourth on Avast's list and gives the company more active users there than the Moscow-based Kaspersky.

""We have about 1 million users per employee,"" Steckler noted. Avast's Marking Director Miloslav Korenko quipped. ""This is the first marketing job in my career that I don't have a marketing budget.""

Steckler--a former senior vice president of sales for Symantec, the makers of Norton--said that Avast has about 20 million more active users than its nearest competitor, AVG, because ""there is no difference in malware protection between free and paid.""

How Avast builds protection

More so than any third-party efficacy test, Avast relies on its reputation with users to fuel its growth. On CNET's Download.com, the free version of Avast is the only program with a 4.5-star rating from readers with more than 10,000 votes. Jindrich Kubec, Avast's director of antivirus research, said that to keep individuals safe Avast must deal with the same problem that all antivirus vendors struggle with. ""The one single biggest challenge is the number of samples every day. This is the biggest challenge for everyone in the industry.""

Also like its competitors, Avast's detection starts with gathering threat samples. Kubec said that the company sees about 50,000 to 60,000 new virus samples per day, while Steckler added that about 15,000 of those are actually unique. The difference is that the former number is the raw number of virus threats detected, whereas the latter is the number of polymorphic virus families. As the name implies, these virus families behave or look similar with only slight variations, so they are considered of the same group.

Kubec also pointed out that the ""bad guys"" are extremely responsive. ""They have very fast reactions. It takes about 3 hours after a threat has been stopped for the virus maker to put out a new one,"" which he clarified to mean a new variant.

Avast has built about 5 million ""honeypots"" around the Web for picking up on threats early, and it also relies heavily on its CommunityIQ database, Kubec said. ""We see hundreds of gigabytes per week in our own feeds, so we have lots of metadata and heuristics over the metadata. We have the automated way of detecting something, and we have the manual power to decide quickly,"" he said.

The honeypot attracts threats and stops them before they reach people. For example, Kubec said, ""we know that some domains are really bad, [they're] just for malware. So we have some honeypots that know the binary from that domain, and then it gets killed."" He cited the CZ.CC, CO.BE, and VB.CC domains, as well as old Soviet domains .SU as notorious sources of malware.

Most if not all major consumer security vendors manage a database like Avast's CommunityIQ, which gets its anonymously contributed security data from its users. Within the program itself, CommunityIQ uses automated processes to gather its data, mostly from the program's behavior shield and anti-rootkit modules. ""Rootkits are considered the most dangerous kinds of malware and the most difficult to remove,"" said Ondrej Vlcek, Avast's chief technical officer. ""So we struck a deal with the maker of the popular GMER to integrate it into Avast. We've developed it further,"" to both integrate it and make it more powerful at rootkit detection, he said.

Seth Rosenblatt/CNET

The data that CommunityIQ gathers includes ""safe"" programs as well as malicious ones, Kubec said, and provides Avast with a broad base of data in exchange for securing your computer. While the ""Little Brother"" implications may worry some, it's clearly a trade people are willing to make. ""About 60 [percent] to 80 percent [of active users] opt in to the community reporting, said Steckler, who added that CommunityIQ is an opt-out choice when you install Avast. That means that during the install, users must actively choose to remove themselves from CommunityIQ, although doing so does not decrease the level of protection that Avast provides.

Preprocessing helps Kubec's team manage the virus samples that come in. By the time that one of his analysts starts working on a sample, he said, they already know its file name and metadata. Not unlike competitor AVG, Avast's virus lab runs the sample in a virtual machine through the company's proprietary tools to get a graphical layout and entropy map of the file. From there, ""we search for something rare in files,"" said Michal Trs, a senior virus analyst at Avast.

One of 30 analysts the company employs, all based from their Prague office, he explained his comment further by saying that he and his colleagues look for code in a file that shouldn't be there, like an executable command hidden in an image file. ""It's not perfect, but it does look for the file signature for metamorphic viruses and polymorphic viruses. We know that our tool is a program that the virus is not prepared for.""

After generating the entropy map and determining that a file is indeed a threat, the analyst generates a checksum for it and pushes the update to Avast's users. A checksum is a fixed number generated by a tool that essentially ""fingerprints"" the file. If the data inside the file changes, whether by a virus or by authorized means, the checksum changes. Similar to how the police might compare fingerprints, the checksum has proven to be an effective tool for verifying a file's contents.

The last step, Vlcek added, is making sure the new rule is risk-free. ""Before we push a rule out we test it so it doesn't hurt the user. We have seen few complaints,"" he said.

The changing threatscape

Defining what constitutes a threat to a person's computer security may appear on its face to be an easy task. Perhaps it once was. Today, however, Kubec said we face a much more challenging task in figuring out what is a threat that a traditional antivirus company ought to handle. ""The border of where we should interfere is very difficult. Some users want more security. Some want less. It's harder to define what is a virus,"" he said.

The bad guys, he continued, can simply buy their way into being bad guys. ""They can buy server hosting, exploit kits, hire interface designers, hire accountants...I believe that the number of people writing the malware is very low, but the number of clients buying it is very high.""

Worse than that, he added, are the way that social engineering is driving creativity in newer threats. ""There was a very strange kind of fraud in Slovakia, where [the people committing the fraud] were getting people to register a username on what looked like a normal site. So you tick [the box] that you accept, and then in the TOS, in the small print it said you owe them $90 per year,"" he said. ""They were not charging you for the software, they're charging you for the link to the software.""

Seth Rosenblatt/CNET

But, Kubec says, the burden of protection should not rely on the Internet service provider. ""ISPs should not alter your results, they should just deliver the data. That's what they're paid for."" And search engines, like Google, he said are ""good"" but ""too slow.""

""When you see a Web-based infection, it's a chain. So should Google block the original site that has a bad iFrame on a good site? I don't know,"" he said, shaking his head. Kubec laid a lot of the blame on unscrupulous ad agencies that he says don't care where the ads come from, even though they are being used to deliver malware and exploit people's computers.

Vlcek explained how that works. ""The JavaScript doesn't usually contain the malicious payload. Instead, it scans the computer for vulnerabilities. It looks at Java, PDFs, Flash, and it only takes one to infect the computer.""

Kubec also said that, at least in Europe, people have been getting malware just from listening to music. ""You can run a standalone music application, which displays an ad. If it hits a Java exploit, you get infected."" He also criticized the blogging tool WordPress for its shared theme plug-ins, because they're often written with backdoors installed, creating yet another vector by which hackers can access your Web site.

Whatever the nature of the threat, the bottom line for Steckler is reduced to Avast's reputation. ""It's not just the community, it's the influencers with the community,"" he said. ""If they see that you're annoying their mother or their friends, they're going to stop recommending you. If we've got the choice between near-term revenue or long-term user happiness, we'll go with long term.""",html

http://news.cnet.com/8301-30686_3-20112800-266/amazon-unveils-kindle-touch-and-kindle-fire-tablet/,Amazon unveils Kindle Touch and Kindle Fire tablet,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Now Playing: Watch this: Amazon Kindle Fire unveiling

Amazon didn't disappoint tech enthusiasts this morning at its big press conference in Manhattan.. The company announced not one, but three new devices, all below the $200 price point.

As Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said more than once during the presentation, the company is all about ""making premium products at non-premium prices."" The new products included three new e-ink e-readers and the much-anticipated Kindle Fire, a tablet for enjoying all of Amazon's multimedia content.

The Kindle Touch, which allows people to easily read on their device one-handed, is designed as a Barnes & Noble Nook-killer and will cost $99. Amazon also showed off a 3G version, which will sell for $149. A cheaper and smaller non-touch control Kindle will sell for $79.

But the big news of the day was the 7-inch Kindle Fire tablet. This Fire is Amazon's stab at the crowded tablet PC market, which is already dominated by Apple's iPad.

But at $199, the Kindle Fire is sure to find a bigger audience than other Apple iPad challengers, namely Research in Motion's BlackBerry Playbook and Google Android tablets from companies such as Samsung. Most other tablets are more than twice the price of the Kindle Fire, retailing for around $500. More importantly, the Kindle Fire is priced even lower than B&N's Nook Color, which retails for $249.

That said, the lower price point means that Amazon hasn't packed the device with specifications found in more expensive tablets. While the device has a dual-core processor, it lacks other features, such as a camera, microphone, and 3G wireless access. Still, the device offers people an inexpensive way to consume movies, music, books, and magazines streamed or downloaded through Amazon's cloud services.

Gartner analyst Michael Gartenberg tweeted that he thinks the Kindle Fire is more of an Apple iPod Touch replacement than an iPad-killer. Indeed, Amazon seems to be going after its core audience of e-reader customers who are interested in a tablet but not willing to spend a lot of money. In other words, this device is geared toward customers who may be considering buying the Barnes & Noble Nook Color rather than those with their heart set on an Apple iPad.

Still, the Kindle Fire is more than an e-reader. It offers the ability to play games and surf the Net. Amazon also announced its own custom Amazon Silk browser for the device that speeds up the download of rich Web sites.

Amazon is also offering free cloud storage to customers of the devices. Since most of the content is backed Amazon's cloud, the Kindle Fire is also wirelessly synced to the cloud service, eliminating the need for users to manually back-up or sync their content.

And Amazon has included its Whispersync technology, which delivers digital books to the Kindle and now will also work with movies and television shows. The benefit here is that people will be able to view a movie or TV show on their home TV, pause it, and then pick up where they left off on their Kindle Fire, much like Netflix allows people to do between its TV, PC, and mobile apps.

In all respects, the Kindle Fire is a device made to consume Amazon content. And Amazon is trying to make it as easy as possible for Kindle Fire users to access that content. Bloomberg reported earlier that the Kindle Fire will come with a 30-day trial for the Amazon Prime service, which is service that includes free two-day shipping from Amazon's store as well as some free video streaming. The service costs $79 a year.

Content is key for Amazon, and it has been in a race with other streaming providers to build its online content library. Recently it announced a deal to license movies and TV shows from 20th Century Fox, bringing its library to roughly 11,000 titles. Netflix is its closest competitor in the video streaming arena, and it has over 20,000 titles available for streaming.

Amazon also plans to deliver digital versions of magazines to the Kindle Fire, and the company has reportedly signed up several publishers, including Conde Nast, Hearst and Meredith, to have digital versions of magazines ready at launch.

The CNET crew was at the New York event where the new products were unveiled. So stay tuned for more stories with hands-on first-impressions of the new devices. There's also an archive of the live blog from the event.",html

It's always exciting when you bring home a new computer. It feels so powerful and fast; you can't imagine ever needing to buy another one again. Unfortunately, neither your excitement nor your PC's performance lasts.

Whether your hard drive is running out of space or your system takes forever to run simple tasks, it might be worth your time to try and revive it before replacing it. Here are some spring cleaning tips to revive your Windows PC:

Free up disk space

The enormous size of modern multimedia files can eat up your hard-drive storage quickly. What once seemed like a laughable amount of storage, can suddenly become insufficient. But are you using that storage efficiently?

Uninstall software. It's easy to forget about software you've installed but haven't used in a while. Get rid of trial software, games you don't play anymore, and other software you rarely use.

Run the Windows Disk Cleanup tool and while you're there, go to the More Options tab to also clean up your system restore files.

Empty your Web browser cache. Over time, you'd be surprised how much space a browser's cache takes up.

Use CCleaner to automate your cleanup tasks

If your hard disk is still short on storage, try running WinDirStat to see what's taking up all that storage

To free up even more disk space, consider using Duplicate File Finder to identify and remove duplicate files on your system.

Recover performance with software tools

Performance on Windows computers tends to degrade over time, but with a few OS tweaks, you can recover some performance.

Defrag your hard drive. Especially after performing massive file deletion tasks, your hard disk is going to be heavily fragmented. Use the default Windows defrag utility or a third-party program like, Defraggler to speed up disk access.

Make Windows start faster. You can use the Windows msconfig utility to prevent programs from starting up automatically, or use CCleaner. You can also bypass the Windows logo by setting the No GUI boot setting Dennis O'Reilly's post

Check for updated hardware drivers for components like graphics cards, printers, and network adapters. Updated drivers often fix bugs and improve performance.

Increase performance with simple hardware upgrades

Simple hardware upgrades can make your system perform better than when it was new.

Adding RAM is still one of the most cost-effective ways to improve PC performance. Check your system specs to confirm the maximum amount of RAM that can be installed. Also, remember that only 64-bit versions of Windows can see above 4GB.

If you're still using a mechanical hard drive in your computer, migrating to an SSD drive

Can't justify the cost of an SSD? Consider upgrading to a hybrid drive

If you're not up for migrating your Windows 7 system to a brand-new drive, SSD cache drives are an easy way to boost performance. They're small, inexpensive SSD drives that can be added to your system without having to migrate Windows or your data.

Check your Windows system security

While you're tuning up your system for performance, it's also a good time to check your system security.

Make sure Windows Update is enabled and scheduled for automatic updates. Updates often contain security patches, so this is essential for keeping your Windows PC secure.

Make sure you have a highly rated firewall and antivirus program installed with automatic updates turned on. Free security programs are OK in a pinch, but they're usually crippled in some way or don't measure up to the premium ones. Internet providers like Comcast and AT&T also provide premium security programs for free with service. And online retailers routinely offer huge discounts after rebates on security software.

Consider adding a physical firewall to your network. An oft-forgotten benefit of Wi-Fi routers is the fact that they serve as a firewall between the Internet and your home network.

Review your system backup plan. Don't have one? Get one. And here's the most important part about a backup plan: test the restore to make sure it actually works.

Clean your hardware the right way

Cleaning your computer gear not only makes them look nice, but also keeps germs at bay and can help your system run better.

What to do with your old PC

If you've decided to go ahead and buy a new PC, you can still use your old one for some great things or sell it to put some cash back in your wallet.

Turn your old PC into a media center PC, networked media storage, Linux test PC, home security monitor, or a backup storage device. Rob Lightner shows you how

Strip it for parts. One of the most reusable parts of an old PC is the hard drive. Pull the internal hard drive out and make your own an external hard drive

If you're going to sell your old PC, we have some helpful tips on how to sell it

That's it. Performing some or all of these tips should help keep your Windows PC running smoothly for at least another year. If you have questions on any of these tips, let us know in the comments below.

If you were expecting to be able to pick up an iPad 2 from Apple between now and April, your best bet may be to get in line at a local retailer.

Just hours into the iPad 2 going up for sale on Apple's online store, the company pushed back ship times across the entire line of devices from two to three days, then five to seven business days, and now two to three weeks. That lead time could stretch even more with shoppers putting in orders throughout the rest of today and into the weekend.

Similar availability problems faced the first iPad, with Apple being unable to keep up with demand. Back then, shipping times did not come down to the magical 24-hour mark until the end of August, some four months after the device had gone on sale in the U.S. In the process, Apple sold more than 300,000 iPads on its first day of availability, and hit 1 million units sold in 28 days. That unexpected demand had also prompted Apple to push back its international release of the device, so as to keep up with sales.

Along with Apple's online store, Web sales of the iPad 2 at Apple partner retailers like Wal-Mart are likely to face similar supply restraints when the device goes on sale later today at 5 p.m. ET. We'll be keeping track of that, along with the scene at a number of retail outlets across the country throughout the day over at our semi-live blog.",html
https://www.cnet.com/news/gone-in-a-flash-facebook-says-adobes-plug-in-is-a-security-risk-no-longer-worth-taking/,Gone in a flash? Facebook says Adobe's plug-in is a security risk no longer worth taking,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Adobe Systems

Adobe Systems' Flash software has come under fire yet again after a prominent Facebook executive called for the end of the animation software.

""It is time for Adobe to announce the end-of-life date for Flash and to ask the browsers to set killbits on the same day,"" Facebook security chief Alex Stamos said in a tweet on Sunday. Stamos joined Facebook last month after less than a year at Yahoo.

On Monday, browser maker Mozilla piled on. In a feisty tweet, its head of Firefox support, Mark Schmidt, declared that Flash is ""blocked by default in Firefox as of now.""

Mozilla offered an understated explanation on a support page about software add-ons: ""Old versions of the Flash Player plugin have known vulnerabilities."" The organization also clarified in a statement that ""we have only disabled the current version of Flash, not all versions and not forever."" Firefox users also can choose to manually activate the disabled plugin.

Adobe on Tuesday posted a security bulletin with an updated version of Flash and a response to the vulnerabilities. Firefox soon after lifted the default block, allowing for the newest version of Flash to run after you download it. The ""outdated"" Flash plugin is still blocked.

""As part of the many security initiatives we engage in to help keep our products and our users safe,"" Adobe said in an emailed statement Tuesday, ""we work closely with our counterparts in other organizations (including the browser vendors) on finding ways to encourage users to stay up-to-date on the latest security updates.""

Stamos' death-to-Flash tweet came a week after cyberthieves released 400GB of internal documents stolen from HackingTeam, a Italian security company that helps governments and other organizations steal information. Those documents included details for exploiting weaknesses in Flash, which the HackingTeam called ""most beautiful Flash bug for the last four years.""

Independent researchers further verified three previously unknown attacks using Adobe's streaming-video software for browsers. HackingTeam even warned developers and companies to be wary.

""Before the attack, HackingTeam could control who had access to the technology, which was sold exclusively to governments and government agencies. Now, because of the work of criminals, that ability to control who uses the technology has been lost,"" the company said in a July 8 press release. ""Terrorists, extortionists and others can deploy this technology at will if they have the technical ability to do so. We believe this is an extremely dangerous situation.""

Whenever Adobe does get around to releasing a version of Flash that isn't being ""actively exploited by publicly known vulnerabilities,"" Mozilla's Schmidt said, Firefox will cease blocking the plugin.

Stamos' call to end the Flash browser plugin echoes a demand by the late Steve Jobs. ""Flash was created during the PC era -- for PCs and mice,"" Apple's former CEO wrote in a 1,600-word open letter, ""Thoughts on Flash,"" in April 2010. ""But the mobile era is about low power devices, touch interfaces and open Web standards -- all areas where Flash falls short.""

Flash was once the de facto standard for websites to run games, stream video and deliver animation over browser software. Before Jobs' high-profile attack on the software, Flash ran on more than 800 million mobile phones manufactured by 20 handset makers. The exception was Apple, which banished Flash from iOS, the operating system that powers the iPhone and iPad, and stopped preinstalling the software on Mac computers. These days, Flash is on the wane as more in the online video industry turn to HTML5, a developing language that can run graphics without plugins.

But while it's fading, Flash is far from forgotten. Flash is still used on 23 percent of the 483,000 Web pages tracked by the HTTP Archive, a resource for Web developers. Even though that usage has dropped from 39 percent three years ago, removing Flash from browsers would break much of today's Web. That's why browser makers such as Google and Microsoft have granted Flash special status even as they try to wean the Web from it and other browser plugins.

Killing Flash, though, would be difficult: It's not just decade-old websites that rely on Flash for streaming video. Many top video networks rely on it, said Jan Ozer, a streaming-media consultant and author. Flash, he said, ""has its negatives, but why banish Flash altogether if companies like NBC and MLB want to use it?""

According to Adobe, more than 500 million devices are ""addressable today with Flash technology"" and 110 million websites run the plugin. Adobe has issued more than a dozen Flash security advisories since the beginning of this year.

Stamos, who helped strengthen Yahoo's security prowess before joining Facebook, tweeted that Adobe needs to set a date for Flash's sunset so that browsers could coordinate their dropping the software.

""Even if 18 months from now, one set date is the only way to disentangle the dependencies and upgrade the whole ecosystem at once.""

The development process is still under way, but Thursday Opera announced a second public beta for the Mac. Opera 10.52 beta 2 has taken such a long time to develop that the version number has been changed from version 10.50.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Despite the month and a half since its last revision, Opera 10.52 beta 2 introduces relatively few new features. The Carakan JavaScript engine has received several performance tweaks, and many of the bugs that affected scrolling have been addressed. Smooth scrolling is now enabled by default. Most notably, Opera has decided to make the browser compatible with older Macs. Unlike the previous beta, this version will work on legacy PowerPC machines. Both this beta and the first one worked on Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger and later.

In casual testing on a Mac Mini with OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, a 1.83Ghz Core 2 Duo processor, and 1GB of RAM, using the SunSpider JavaScript test to compare Opera 10.52 beta 2 to Google Chrome 5.0.375.6, the latest development version of Google Chrome still finished slightly faster than the latest Opera beta. Opera scored an average of 545.8 milliseconds over three runs, while Chrome notched 477.0 ms averaged over three runs. Chrome's speed increased by 85.53 ms as compared to the version tested in February, while Opera's was 52.53 ms faster than its previous version. If you're a Mac user looking to give your browsing a kick in the pants, one of these two browsers is clearly the way to go.

Multitouch trackpad gestures are supported in this beta, too. You can now take advantage of pinch-to-zoom, two-finger swipe to scroll, three-finger swipe to navigate your browser history, and one that Opera claims will make the browser window transparent. The full changelog for Opera 10.52 beta 2 can be read here.

Although the company hasn't explicitly stated this, it's clear that Opera hopes that getting a speedy and fully synchronizable browser onto phones plays a big part in reinvigorating interest in their desktop version, which was quickly surpassed by Google Chrome in browser market share.",html

Update at 9:10 a.m. PDT: The iOS 4 update is not yet available. We expect it to go live about 10 a.m. PDT.

Update at 10:10 a.m. PDT: The iOS 4 update is now available for download.

As the iPhone 4's Thursday release inches closer, Apple whets our appetite Monday with the release of its latest iPhone and iPod Touch operating system. First announced in April, iOS 4 adds a gallery of features, from the long-awaited and expected to the small and surprising.

For a refresher on the look and feel of iOS 4, check out our initial hands-on of the developer release.

To get the update, simply connect your device to iTunes and follow the steps. It's free for both iPhone and iPod Touch users--in the past the latter group users had to pay a small fee--though iOS 4 is not compatible with first generation models of either device. Also, remember that the iPhone 3G will not support the new multitasking feature.

We'll follow up with a review of iOS 4 later Monday, but here's a recap of the new features in the meantime.

Multitasking

Finally, the iPhone joins its smartphone rivals with the ability to run multiple apps simultaneously.

Home screen folders

Now you'll be able to save home screen by organizing related--or even unrelated--apps into folders.

E-mail in-box

Among other things, you'll you get a unified e-mail in-box, support for multiple Exchange accounts, and the option for viewing e-mails by thread.

Enterprise

IT departments will welcome enhanced data protection, mobile device management, and wireless app distribution.

iBooks

You can share books between the iPhone and the iPad with one purchase.

Game Center

This feature is scheduled for release later this year so we won't get it right away. But when it comes it will bring options like a social gaming network, the ability to invite friends to games, and the opportunity for setting up two people to play.

http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20003739-264.html,Jobs: Why Apple banned Flash from the iPhone,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"In a rare open letter published Thursday, Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs has detailed the technological reasons behind his company's refusal to let Adobe Systems' Flash Player onto the iPhone: he thinks it's a relic, not the future.

""Flash was created during the PC era--for PCs and mice,"" Jobs said in the letter. ""New open standards created in the mobile era, such as HTML5, will win on mobile devices (and PCs too). Perhaps Adobe should focus more on creating great HTML5 tools for the future, and less on criticizing Apple for leaving the past behind.""

Jobs also knocked Flash for being proprietary, sapping battery power, not supporting multitouch interfaces, posing security risks, and being unstable. ""Flash is the No. 1 reason Macs crash,"" Jobs said.

Overall, his message is this: Flash is flawed, Apple doesn't need it, and the company is using its considerable power and influence to make it obsolete.

Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen called Jobs' letter a ""smokescreen"" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. That there are more than 100 applications available today built with Adobe's tool to translate Flash apps into native iPhone apps shows Apple's objections have ""nothing to do with technology.""

Narayen also turned around Jobs' complaint about Flash causing Mac crashes, pinning the blame on Mac OS X, and said Jobs' complaints about Flash draining batteries fast are ""patently false."" In addition, where Jobs complained of Flash shortcomings, ""for every one of these accusations made there is proprietary lock-in"" that block Adobe from fixing it.

Flash Player, a programming foundation that's ubiquitous on personal computers, is widely used for tasks such as online games, photo editors, and video streaming, and with the upcoming version 10.1, Adobe is trying anew to bring Flash to mobile devices.

The software is designed to work on phones using RIM's BlackBerry OS, Microsoft's Windows Phone 7, Palm's WebOS, Nokia's Symbian, and Google's Android. Adobe has been increasingly vocal about its dissatisfaction with the Apple situation, especially after Apple barred a new tool from Adobe that would let Flash developers turn their programs into native iPhone applications.

A chief benefit of Flash is its cross-platform design that lets programmers reach a multitude of devices easily, but missing some of the highest-profile mobile devices on the market--the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch--weakens the Flash sales pitch. Apple's move comes as a collection of Web technologies--HTML retooled for applications, Cascading Style Sheets for better formatting, faster JavaScript for running Web-based programs--are coalescing into a more viable replacement for today's Flash.

Jobs struck back against Adobe's protestations with a list of six reasons Apple is opposed to Flash. The most important, he said, is that Apple refuses to be beholden to another organization's programming foundation.

""We know from painful experience that letting a third-party layer of software come between the platform and the developer ultimately results in substandard apps, and hinders the enhancement and progress of the platform. If developers grow dependent on third-party development libraries and tools, they can only take advantage of platform enhancements if and when the third party chooses to adopt the new features,"" Jobs said. ""We cannot be at the mercy of a third party deciding if and when they will make our enhancements available to our developers.""

Adobe is working to improve Flash, notably on the Mac, where the company has acknowledged its performance lags. In addition, Flash Player 10.1 adds support for multitouch, and a new Flash Player 10.1 beta can take advantage of Mac OS X hardware acceleration for playing videos encoded with the H.264 technology.

Jobs' open letters are unusual but not unknown. In 2007, for instance, he wrote about Apple and the environment, and about copy-protected music.

Apple and Adobe 'have grown apart'

The latest letter recounts some history when Apple and Adobe jointly built the desktop-publishing industry. Although Apple and Adobe still have many joint customers in that design arena, the days of the close alliance are over, Jobs said.

""Since that golden era, the companies have grown apart. Apple went through its near-death experience, and Adobe was drawn to the corporate market with their Acrobat products. Today the two companies still work together to serve their joint creative customers--Mac users buy around half of Adobe's Creative Suite products--but beyond that, there are few joint interests.""

Adobe has a new close ally, now: Google, which is working closely with Adobe engineers to get Flash working well on Google's Android operating system. Android is a strong competitor to the iPhone OS.

--Apple CEO Steve Jobs ""Adobe claims that we are a closed system and that Flash is open, but in fact, the opposite is true.""

""Google is happy to be partnering with Adobe to bring the full Web, great applications, and developer choice to the Android platform,"" Android engineering leader Andy Rubin said in a blog post on Adobe's Web site a week ago.

Jobs sees things differently about Flash and the ""full Web"" argument.

""Adobe has repeatedly said that Apple mobile devices cannot access ""the full Web"" because 75 percent of video on the Web is in Flash. What they don't say is that almost all this video is also available in a more modern format, H.264, and viewable on iPhones, iPods, and iPads,"" Jobs said. ""Another Adobe claim is that Apple devices cannot play Flash games. This is true. Fortunately, there are over 50,000 games and entertainment titles on the App Store, and many of them are free. There are more games and entertainment titles available for iPhone, iPod, and iPad than for any other platform in the world.""

In other words, Apple has enough clout with its mobile devices that it doesn't need to worry about relying on Flash.

It appears that Adobe's criticisms that Apple is closed also raised Jobs' hackles.

""Adobe claims that we are a closed system and that Flash is open, but in fact, the opposite is true,"" Jobs said.

Plenty of developers and others in the industry disagree with Jobs that Apple's system is open, though. Most notably, Apple controls the App Store, the sole authorized mechanism to add applications to an iPhone.

But Jobs rightly points out that Apple's work with HTML5 and other ""Open Web"" standards is open. Apple has helped nurture many new standards with WebKit, the open-source browser engine underlying Apple's Safari and Google's Chrome--and used alongside Flash in another Adobe programming foundation called AIR (the Adobe Integrated Runtime).

Google, a Web powerhouse, is a strong believer in the Web as an applications foundation, and to that end, it is funding work on HTML5 and related standards for Chrome and Chrome OS, and using them in its online services. The Open Web work is even attracting some degree of support from Microsoft, which has pledged HTML5 support in Internet Explorer 9.

It'll take a long time for all the Open Web standards to mature. Many of them are still under development--on Tuesday, Firefox backer Mozilla said it's holding off one new HTML feature called WebSockets until the technology settles down. It will take time for the standards to be hammered out, more time for them to show up in browsers, more time for people to upgrade, and more time for developers to learn and embrace the technology.

In the meantime, Flash is understood by many programmers, and it is widely, if not universally, deployed. Adobe isn't standing still, either.

But Apple is willing to take a stand, as it did with ditching floppy drives, supporting FireWire, and dumping DVI in favor of DisplayPort video connectors. Not all Apple's initiatives succeed, but Apple's influence today is stronger than it has been in years. So although Flash developers won't ditch Adobe tomorrow, Jobs' letter should be taken seriously.

As promised, Apple let Mac OS X Lion out of its cage this morning.

Version 10.7 of the operating system has more than 250 new features, Apple said, but an installation disc isn't one of them: it's available today for $29.99 as a 3.49GB download only.

Apple enjoys pushing the computing industry into the future by dropping technology it deems to be from the past--for example floppy drives missing from the first iMac--and those who want a real-world copy of the OS will have to wait until Apple releases it on a USB thumb drive next month for $69.

The Mac OS X download, available through the Mac App Store, dovetails with Apple's new MacBook Air and Mac Mini Lion-based computers. These new models are updated with Intel's modern Sandy Bridge processors and a high-speed Thunderbolt data transfer port--and none has a DVD drive for the next OS upgrade.

One new feature in Lion is a range of multitouch gestures that let people control on-screen content with their fingers. In addition, the platform lets applications run in a full-screen mode, something Windows users are accustomed to.

For CNET's take on the operating system, check Mac OS X Lion review: A worthy upgrade for the price.

Task management is a challenge for people juggling many jobs at once on a computer. Here, Apple updated its approach to the problem with Mission Control, which provides a glimpse into all the programs running on the Mac. The operating system's Launchpad feature helps to quickly access and launch applications from the operating system.

Lion's Versions feature automatically saves people's work and allows them to go back to different versions of a file. A new Resume feature helps users get back to where they left off with their applications after the Mac has been shut down or restarted, similar to how some Web browsers can launch by reopening the tabs a person had been using.

Apple

Mac OS X Lion is also the first version of Apple's operating system to come with the Mac App Store built-in. The marketplace launched in January as a download for Snow Leopard users.

Apple's latest operating system update comes just a day after the company posted an impressive fiscal third quarter. Apple reported yesterday that its revenue hit $28.57 billion during the period, and it earned a profit of $7.31 billion. The company sold 20.34 million iPhones and 9.25 million iPads during the period, representing a gain of 142 percent and 183 percent year-over-year, respectively, but Mac sales were relatively light.

During its earnings call yesterday, Apple announced its intention to release Mac OS X Lion today. Earlier this morning, the company took its online store down in anticipation of the launch of its new products.

Firefox just gets an add-on. Mozilla Contacts is an experimental new add-on for the browser that provides one-click access to your address books, provided that you've synchronized them.

Right now, the add-on has fairly limited features and functionality. It can sync contacts from Gmail, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Plaxo. Mac users can also sync with with local address books, and there are plans to incorporate Thunderbird, locally stored contacts in Windows and other social-networking systems.

Once installed, Contacts can be accessed only from your Tools menu. It opens up a new tab that's limited to entering in user accounts, although helpfully it already has a button for wiping that data. Your contacts list can be viewed in list or icon mode and will default to Twitter avatars as it merges contact data.

Currently, you have to give a site permission to use the data from Contacts, but some popular sites are supported. These include Flickr, Amazon, Yelp, and Gravatar. The add-on will automatically discover Webfinger and HCard data, and if you're looking at a contact in list view there's a search button that should search the Web for information about that person. This feature wasn't working for me, but it's a good idea.

Mozilla Contacts is fun to play with, but unless you're an early adopter there's not a lot here just yet to excite the average user. It is good to see that Mozilla is addressing a potentially killer feature in Google, given the easy ties between Chrome and Gmail.",html

It turns out that a misfiring antivirus program called VIPRE, made by the GFI Software company, falsely identified a Microsoft Windows directory as malicious software.

GFI publicly apologized for the problem with VIPRE today in a post explaining that the directory used by Windows' Slovenian language files--C:\WINDOWS\SL--is the same path used by the StarLogger keylogger.

""At some point several years after the original detection was written, Windows Live started using that directory to install Slovenian language files,"" GFI Security General Manager Alex Eckelberry wrote. ""Samsung started pre-installing Windows Live, including all the languages, and there you have the problem we're having today.""

Eckelberry said the errant detection code has been fixed in VIPRE's latest update.

By the time Samsung released a statement last night explaining what really happened, hundreds of articles and blog posts had repeated the claim.

The false allegations against Samsung, one of the world's largest manufacturers, arose in a guest article by Mohamed Hassan on Network World's Web site yesterday that reported the laptops contained key logging software.

It's unclear why Network World, owned by IDG, didn't investigate Hassan's allegations independently--or test the Samsung laptops with other antivirus software--before publishing. The Network World article speculated that ""Samsung's conduct may be illegal"" and ""we see a class-action lawsuit in your future."" (Samsung's public relations department apparently didn't respond until the article was published.)

A post at CNET's sister publication, ZDNet, this morning said: ""Replicating the false-positive is easy--simply create an empty folder called SL in the Windows folder and scan it.""",html

Eager to get your hands on the latest and greatest version of Apple's iOS for your iPhone or iPod Touch? Apparently you're not alone, as CNET readers, Twitter users, and our own staff members have been experiencing heavily extended download times, as well as download failures on the software update.

For this reporter, the start-to-finish time to grab Apple's 378MB iOS 4 firmware update (which is one of Apple's biggest yet) was estimated at 4 hours and 29 minutes, averaging 20KB to 30KB downloaded per second. It also had to be restarted twice, due to connection drops on the other end. By comparison, a successful download of a 379MB file from Apple's iPhone developer center Web site took just 17 minutes on the same connection.

If history has taught us anything though, it's that the download will get faster--it will just take time. The same thing happened when iOS 3 was released, prompting download times in excess of an hour for the much smaller 230MB file.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20119684-264/wahoo-hardware-accelerated-opera-12-alpha-arrives/,Wahoo! Hardware-accelerated Opera 12 alpha arrives,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"OSLO, Norway--Opera Software took the hardware acceleration plunge today with the release of its first alpha version of Opera 12, code-named Wahoo.

Hardware acceleration offers a range of benefits to Web browsers--faster performance, lower battery consumption, and new features that would be otherwise impractical. So it's no surprise that browser makers--catalyzed in part by Microsoft's Internet Explorer 9--have been rebuilding their engines to support the idea.

But Opera, while not the first with hardware acceleration, thinks it's got a competitive approach. It uses hardware for everything its Vega display engine handles--font display, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) effects, Canvas 2D graphics, and WebGL 3D graphics. (You can download the Opera 12 alpha, also known as Opera Next, for Windows, Mac, and Linux.)

The Norwegian browser maker had two priorities with acceleration, which is named after a fast-swimming fish, said Jan Standal, vice president of desktop products, in an interview at the company's Up North Web event here.

""One, it was more important to get it right than get it fast,"" Standal said. ""Two, we wanted to reach as many users as possible.""

Reaching Windows XP

""Reach"" means offering the feature to as many people as possible--those using Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, and those using older versions of Windows such as XP that IE9 doesn't support. But reaching XP isn't always possible, so, like other browsers, Opera uses a blacklist to disable hardware acceleration on some machines.

""The issue with XP is that many drivers are not supported anymore, and they will have bugs that will not get fixed,"" said Karl Anders, who manages the desktop version of Opera (and the company's seventh employee, by the way, starting the day the browser project became independent from Norway's Telenor phone service company).

Opera 12 should ship in final form later this year, said Christen Krogh, chief development officer, in an earlier interview.

Opera hopes Wahoo's alpha release will help the company pin down what hardware and drivers works and what doesn't. ""If you see a bug, try to turn off hardware acceleration by setting opera:config#UserPrefs|EnableHardwareAcceleration to 0, restart Opera, and see if the bug is still there,"" advised Opera's Tommy Olsen in a blog post yesterday. He also requested that people report any problems in the post's comments.

For its ""reach"" priority, Opera 12 uses a display engine called Vega that tap into the graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware power but that also fall back to the regular central processing unit (CPU) for what the company calls ""software acceleration.""

""Vega has software back end and hardware back end,"" Standal said. ""You can get decent performance with the CPU back end and even better performance with the GPU back end.""

For hardware acceleration, Opera taps into graphics cards' direct interfaces. Initially Opera 12 only uses the OpenGL interface that's standard on Mac OS and Linux but second fiddle to Microsoft's DirectX on Windows.

WebGL for 3D Web games

WebGL, though, won't work unless hardware acceleration is enabled, though Opera is looking at some options to improve its availability, Standal said.

WebGL is essentially a JavaScript-based interface to OpenGL ES, a stripped-down version of full OpenGL that's designed for mobile phones and other devices less powerful than personal computers. Opera and allies including Mozilla and Google hope it will usher in a new era of Web games in particular.

Web developers aren't leading the WebGL charge, though, Standal said. ""We see game developers moving into the WebGL world. It's not Web developers taking the lead,"" he said. ""WebGL gives them a fairly familiar environment to operate in.""

Anders agreed. ""OpenGL is generally quite well understood,"" he said, and some game developers are eager for a real 3D interface for Web games. ""We've seen people implement 3D engines just with [2D] Canvas because WebGL is not out there.""

Internet Explorer doesn't support WebGL, though, undermining some advocates hope that WebGL can be considered a standard feature among modern browsers. Opera Chief Technology Officer Haakon Wium Lie believes Microsoft will change its mind, though.

""I don't think they have an interest in not doing WebGL,"" Lie said. ""I think they will come on board.""

WebGL also figures into Opera's push to get its browsers on to TVs and TV set-top boxes. At its Up North Web event, the company demonstrated WebGL running on a Broadcom set-top box reference design with dual 1.2GHz processors, a relatively high-end model.

Other changes

Opera 12 also gets some other features. Among them:

 The ability to control a computer's camera. For now, Opera is using the Device API approach, one that not all browser makers favor, but the company didn't want to wait longer to enable the feature so that Web apps could, for example, snap a profile picture.

 The ability to add Web pages to Opera's speed dial page directly from the address bar. Speed dial, which shows when people launch a new tab, lets people click on large icons for often-used pages. (As of Opera 11.50, speed dial also enables use of more active icons called speed dial extensions.

 Themes to let people customize the look of Opera, for example by adding graphics behind the speed dial page icons.

 Full support for EcmaScript 5.1, the standards-group project that underlies JavaScript.

 Support for horizontal and vertical antialiasing when displaying fonts with Microsoft's DirectWrite interface.

Opera first released a pre-alpha build of Wahoo in July.

Rather than a dramatic redo, version 8.1 builds on the improvements made in the previous version. The new version is faster, has better removal abilities, and introduces a behavioral detection engine.

Called Genotype, Ad-Aware's heuristic-based behavioral detection engine isn't explicitly called out in the interface. However, I noticed that files that had been flagged falsely as threats in earlier versions were no longer called out as such, and the Quick Scan was able to complete in about three minutes, as opposed to 10 minutes in the previous version. These are empirical observations, of course, but this version's improvements should be easy to see for longtime users of Ad-Aware.

Removal techniques have also been improved. Lavasoft is calling the new system Neutralizer, although it's not called out as such in the program interface. What users will see is a ""family"" of grouped similar threats, such as cookies, the category of the threat, and the action taken. The program defaults to the Recommended action, which means you need to click on the drop-down menu to the right of the listing to see what action will be taken on a per-threat basis. The big action buttons introduced in version 8 still reside at the bottom of the window, which feels further than necessary--it'd be better to have the action button closer to where the mouse already is, at the top of the window.

There is one big change to the interface in v8.1. At the bottom left corner of the window, there's a toggle to switch between Simple mode and Advanced mode. Simple mode is for users who are set-it-and-forget-it types, with fewer options displayed. Advanced mode allows for deeper settings customization. There's also a gaming mode, so that full protection continues to run while you play games or watch videos, but detected threats won't interrupt your entertainment until you're done.

Fans of personalization get more skin action in this version, too. In addition to the included skins, the community support offered at MyLavaSoft now includes community-sourced translations and skins.

However, fans of the free version do not get all the features available in the paid upgrades. Antivirus is only for paying customers, and while rootkit detection is present, behavior-based heuristics and real-time registry protection are not. Ad-Aware Free cannot scan networked drives, and even a basic feature like the scheduler remains off-limits in the free version. The Ad-Aware toolbox for system tweaks is only available in the Pro version. I encountered a pop-up for the upgrade, although Lavasoft told me that this was an infrequent occurrence. Ad-Aware Plus is available for $26.95, and Ad-Aware Pro is $39.95, and both have a 30-day trial.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20078295-1/apple-updates-macbook-air-mac-mini/,"Apple updates MacBook Air, Mac Mini",,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Now Playing: Watch this: Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, Summer 2011)

Following months of fervent speculation, Apple has updated its MacBook Air laptop with new Intel Sandy Bridge CPU options, a data port for high-speed Thunderbolt peripherals, and a backlit keyboard (which was present in the original MacBook Air, but absent from the 2010 version). Not included, however, were other rumored changes, such as a black-colored chassis or a mobile broadband antenna.

Also new are updated versions of the Mac Mini, which gets a Thunderbolt port (while retaining HDMI output) as well as faster CPUs. However, the built-in DVD drive is now gone from the entire Mac Mini line.

The timing of this new hardware coincides with the release of OS X Lion , the latest update to Apple's OS X operating system for Mac desktops and laptops. Lion was previously confirmed for a July release, via the OS X Mac App Store, and many sources predicted updated hardware for the MacBook Air, Mac Mini desktop, and Mac Pro tower desktop at the same time.

The MacBook Air, a thin laptop with either an 11- or 13-inch display, was last updated in October 2010, making this an unusual refresh in that it comes less than one year after the previous models. But the MacBook Air, despite its popularity and positive reviews, was saddled with a processor from Intel's older Core 2 Duo series. Since then, Intel has gone through two generations of Core i-series CPUs, which are found in current MacBook Pro laptops. With this update, Apple is effectively leapfrogging a generation of processors, in order to use the most current CPUs. The Mac Mini, last updated in June 2010, has also been updated to use Intel's latest Core i-series chips.

Notably, the $999 white MacBook now appears to be discontinued, making the 11-inch Air the new baseline MacBook model.

In a recent CNET poll, we asked readers which single hardware update to the MacBook Air they would pick as a must-have, and they overwhelmingly chose new Intel Core i-series processors, at 54 percent, over backlit keyboards, Thunderbolt, mobile broadband, and a black chassis.

The MacBook Air updates are available in both the 13- and 11-inch models. The 13-inch version starts at $1,299 and includes a 1.7GHz Intel Core i5 (second-generation) CPU, 128GB flash storage, and 4GB of RAM. The 11-inch version starts at $999 and includes a 1.6GHz Core i5 CPU; despite earlier rumors to the contrary, however, the 11-inch version still includes only 64GB of flash storage and 2GB of RAM (both are doubled in the $1,199 model). Both MacBook Air models can be built to order with more storage and faster Core i7 CPUs.

Apple

The new Mac Mini is available in two familiar default configurations, starting with a $599 model that includes a 2.3GHz Core i5 chip, and going to up a $799 model with a 2.5GHz Core i5 chip that also features a dedicated AMD Radeon HD 6630M graphics chip. Perhaps the biggest news, however, is that the new Thunderbolt-enabled Mac Mini drops the optical drive altogether--so those using the Mac Mini as a home theater PC will no longer have a quick and easy way to play DVDs. (The Mini can utilize the same ""CD/DVD sharing"" option found on the Air, so it can access optical drives on nearby Macs and PCs.)

Also available is a ""server"" version of the Mini with a 2.0GHz Intel Core i7 CPU, dual 500GB hard drives, and 4GB memory for $999.

The updated versions of both the MacBook Air and the Mac Mini are available to order immediately, and should be in Apple stores and other retailers soon.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57566162-93/google-heres-how-we-handle-government-requests-about-you/,Google: Here's how we handle government requests about you,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Privacy is a constant concern for Internet users, and Google today detailed how it approaches government requests for user data

That includes a new section the company today added to its Transparency Report that answers questions users may have, such as ""In what situations wouldn't you tell me about a request for my information?"" (The answer is: Google can't notify you if your account is closed or if the company is legally prohibited from doing so. ""We sometimes fight to give users notice of a data request by seeking to lift gag orders or unseal search warrants."")

Google has a pretty fine line to walk when it comes to privacy. It collects a vast amount of data about individuals that can allow it to determine who a person is, where they're located, and what they like, among other items. That information helps Google deliver better results and services, but it also threatens anonymity online. And government agencies increasingly rely on Google for information about users.

As Google Chief Legal Officer David Drummond wrote in a blog post today to mark Data Privacy Day:

""It's important for law enforcement agencies to pursue illegal activity and keep the public safe. We're a law-abiding company, and we don't want our services to be used in harmful ways. But it's just as important that laws protect you against overly broad requests for your personal information.""

The blog post comes about a week after Google released its latest Transparency Report. That report revealedthat the number of requests from U.S. authorities for information about users has been steadily growing. In the second half of 2012, Google received 8,438 U.S. requests for information, up 6 percent from the first half of 2012. Globally, Google received 21,389 requests, up 2 percent from the first half of the year.

Google today noted that along with the new section in its transparency report, it also will continue pushing for updating laws like the U.S. Electronic Communications Privacy Act. In addition, it will continue its ""long-standing strict process for handling these kinds of requests.""

Here's a rundown of that process, according to Drummond:

Google scrutinizes the request carefully to make sure it's legal and complies with Google's policies. To consider complying, a request typically must be made in writing, signed by an authorized official, and issued under an appropriate law.

Google evaluates the scope of the request. If it's too broad, it may refuse to provide the information or seek to narrow the request. Drummond noted Google does this frequently.

Google notifies users about legal demand when appropriate. Sometimes it can't, either because it's legally prohibited or because it doesn't have a user's verified contact information.

Google requires that government agencies conducting criminal investigations use a search warrant to compel it to provide a user's search query information and private content stored in a Google account, like Gmail messages, documents, photos, and YouTube videos.

""We're proud of our approach, and we believe it's the right way to make sure governments can pursue legitimate investigations while we do our best to protect your privacy and security,"" Drummond said.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9931412-7.html,Google diving into 3D mapping of oceans,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"We've got Google Earth and Google Sky. Next up will be a map of the world below sea level--Google Ocean.

The company has assembled an advisory group of oceanography experts, and in December invited researchers from institutions around the world to the Mountain View, Calif., Googleplex. There, they discussed plans for creating a 3D oceanographic map, according to sources familiar with the matter.

The tool--for now called Google Ocean, the sources say, though that name could change--is expected to be similar to other 3D online mapping applications. People will be able to see the underwater topography, called bathymetry; search for particular spots or attractions; and navigate through the digital environment by zooming and panning. (The tool, however, is not to be confused with the ""Google Ocean"" project by France-based Magic Instinct Software that uses Google Earth as a visualization tool for marine data.)

--Stephen P. Miller, Scripps Institution of Oceanography ""We hope that one of the outcomes of Google Ocean will be an understanding of how much remains to be explored.""

Asked to comment on Google Ocean, a Google spokeswoman said the company had ""nothing to announce right now.""

Oceanography researchers, however, say such a tool would be incredibly useful.

""There is no real terrain or depth model for the ocean in Google Earth,"" said Tim Haverland, a geospatial application developer at the Fisheries Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). ""You can't get in a submarine and in essence fly through the water and explore ocean canyons yet.""

Google Ocean will feature a basic layer that shows the depth of the sea floor and will serve as a spatial framework for additional data, sources said, adding that Google plans to try to fill in some areas of the map with high-resolution images for more detail.

Additional data will be displayed as overlying layers that depict phenomena like weather patterns, currents, temperatures, shipwrecks, coral reefs, and algae blooms, much like the National Park Service and NASA provide additional data for Google Earth and Google Sky.

""Google will basically just provide the field and then everyone will come flocking to it,"" predicted Stephen P. Miller, head of the Geological Data Center at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. ""There will be peer pressure to encourage people to get their data out there.""

David Sandwell and Walter Smith/Scripps Institute of Oceanography

While satellite imagery has the entire globe covered, as well as a good amount of known outer space, much less is known about the bodies of water that cover about 70 percent of the planet. Only a small percentage of the sea floor has been mapped in detail by sonar.

""It would take about 100 ship years to map the oceans at high resolution,"" said Dave Sandwell, a professor of geophysics at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

Sandwell speculated that Google will get at least some of the basic sea floor data from Scripps' . Created from ship sonar soundings and satellites, it infers the depth of the sea floor based on the tiny bumps and dips in the ocean's surface.

To bring more clarity to the sea floor, Sandwell and others said, Google will likely use high-resolution grids from oceanographic institutions showing the depths of select areas of the seas and paste them in. Data for those grids, which cover a very small portion of the sea floor, are created by ships using multibeam sonar.

One possible source for Google Ocean data are detailed ""tiles"" from multibeam and predicted topography compiled by the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) of Columbia University. Tiles are high-resolution sun-shaded images as well as digital elevation models covering the entire global ocean that allow for interactivity similar to Google Earth, where you can get different views by zooming in and out and by tilting the planet's surface.

GeoMapAppVG/Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University

""Our application gets data from databases over the Internet without the user having to know the name of the database or how to connect to it. Google could talk to our databases,"" said William B. F. Ryan, an earth and environmental studies professor at Columbia's LDEO.

Ryan cautioned that ""Google would have to put the tiles on their servers because their public of millions would bring the servers at Columbia University to their knees.""

On top of the depth map, and in addition to the select high-resolution tiled areas, there will likely be various layers of specialized data from different sources. For example, NOAA already has made public visual information for Google Earth related to sea hotspots around coral reefs, Gulf of Mexico marine debris, surface temperatures and wave heights in the Great Lakes, and shipwrecks.

In addition to the ""wow factor"" Google Ocean will no doubt have for amateur oceanographers, marine enthusiasts, and anyone fascinated by the movie , the project has the potential to promote more collaboration and advance research.

""We hope that one of the outcomes of Google Ocean will be an understanding of how much remains to be explored,"" said Miller of Scripps. ""We know far more about the surface of Mars from a few weeks of radar surveying in orbit than we know of the bottom of the ocean after two centuries.""",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-20060464-83.html,LastPass CEO reveals details on security breach,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Following yesterday's revelation of a likely security breach at password management company LastPass, the company's CEO is revealing more details about the incident and trying to offer some comfort and advice to his users.

Speaking yesterday with PC World, LastPass CEO Joe Siegrist admits he may have been too ""alarmist"" in sounding the alarm bell over the potential security breach. But the anomalies the company found when looking over its logs raised too much of a red flag.

Siegrist explained that he doesn't think a lot of data would've been hacked, but just enough to capture a small number of user names and passwords. Though the passwords were in an encrypted format, those combined with the usernames could give hackers enough of a starting point to hunt for accounts with weak master passwords. The use of a master password is critical as it can unlock the door to all of a user's Web site passwords, one reason why sites like LastPass urge users to use complex, non-dictionary passwords.

In fact, Siegrist asserted that users with a strong master password have no reason to worry at this point. It's people with weaker passwords who could be a bit more vulnerable. For such users, he's now advising them not only to replace their master password with a strong one, but also replace the individual passwords on certain critical accounts, such as e-mail and banking.

Beyond those words of wisdom, Siegrist told PC World that the company is now forcing users to prove that they're coming from a known IP address or that they still have access to their e-mail. The CEO believes those extra steps should stop any hacker who may have guessed someone's master password. The company has also locked down certain services on the servers that were caught up in the incident and is investigating further to see if it finds any additional clues.

LastPass is continuing to provide further updates on the situation through its ongoing blog.

Security research firm Duo Security also offered its thoughts on the LastPass breach with some advice on what users can do at this point.",html

Released exclusively through CNET Download.com, Do Not Track Plus 2.0.4 follows last year's beta release with a greatly expanded feature set, better performance, and is available on four of the five major browsers. You can download Do Not Track Plus for Firefox (Windows | Mac), Chrome (Windows | Mac), Internet Explorer (Windows only), and Safari (Windows | Mac).

The intent of the free add-on is as much to educate as it is to protect, explained Bill Kerrigan, CEO of Abine, which makes Do Not Track Plus (DNT+). ""We want to help people understand what's happening when they're tracked, and give them a sense of control over the Internet that doesn't impact their experience,"" he told CNET yesterday.

DNT+ blocks sites and ads from tracking you, unless you give them explicit permission to do so. For most sites, it actually rebuilds tools like social-networking buttons on the fly so you can still get your social on without sacrificing privacy or site load times. It also blocks ad networks and companies from following you around the Web.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

""We want to stop people from being beholden to advertisers,"" said CTO Andy Sudbury, but he cautioned that there's more to it than that. ""The main idea here is building privacy tools for everyday users. We want to be enabling technology, rather than an experience at the expense of functionality.""

Unlike with traditional ad-blockers or JavaScript blockers, Abine's chiefs argue that their add-on will let you experience the Web as it's currently intended by site developers. You're just not sacrificing your privacy on the altar of the Internet-powered data-scraping machine, goes the logic.

DNT+ installs as a browser toolbar button. The icon reflects the number of tracking blocks against the site you're viewing. Click the button and a drop-down window appears with trackers separated into three categories: social buttons, ad networks, and companies. If there's something marked ""verbotten"" that you want back, like a Twitter button, clicking it will resurrect it.

The add-on also has links back to Abine's sites that explain how it works, so that there's some daylight shed on how it operates. The social button rebuild is effective because it prevents the buttons from tracking you until you click on them. This is important because social buttons will phone home every time you load a page with them on it, whether or not you've actually shared the site to a specific social network.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

The add-on also links to an explanation from Abine of what opting out of ad-tracking is and what the consequences of opting out are. Where blocking prevents the ads from appearing outright, that has potentially harmful consequences for site operations. DNT+'s opt out installs anti-tracking cookies that allows ads to continue to be served, but prevents them from following you.

If you're curious about which companies are tracking you, clicking that section of the add-on reveals the real names of targeted advertisers. The explanation there helps you identify those companies.

Some sites, said Sudbury, load the social buttons differently from most, a customization that prevents the buttons from being re-rendered properly. While Abine's CEO and CTO clearly felt that this wasn't enough of a problem to keep the company from releasing the add-on, they did admit that this was a problem that would be fixed in the coming months.

DNT+ can be toggled on or off very quickly, without having to disable the add-on, via a power button icon that appears in the upper-left corner of the drop-down window.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

As noted above, if you're a friending social addict, Plus-oneing, Facebooking, and Twittering everything in sight, there's a chance that the social networking button disruption on a few big sites could induce a rage seizure. I lost some social networking functionality on a few major sites because of the add-on. Most of these came back when I re-activated those specific social buttons in the add-on. In general, though, I experienced very little loss of ""modern-Web"" functionality. Certainly, I didn't miss the motorcycle glove ads that have been following me around the Web for the past four months, and that's even with the W3C-standard Do Not Track header enabled.

The Do Not Track header from which DNT+ derives its name is an HTML header that broadcasts a warning to ad networks not to follow you as you bop from site to site. The problem with it is that while it may have approval from the W3C and most browser vendors, the only enforcement mechanism is the honor system.

Sudbury noted that DNT+ broadcasts the standard DNT header, but doesn't rely on it because the header lacks ""enforcement on the FTC level.""

Internet Explorer may strike some as a curious candidate for DNT+ because of its built-in Tracking Protection List, but Sudbury explained that the TPL is no different than an ad-blocker. ""It's great that [Microsoft] put that in as an option, but the TPL is a crude protection mechanism. We block tracking without blocking experience,"" he said.

He added that Abine was one of Microsoft's original partner providers for the TPL feature, and continues to be one.

Going forward, Kerrigan says that Abine plans to improve how the add-on interacts with the occasional social networking instances that still give it problems. Abine also plans to release a suite release a suite of products, many based on a freemium model for its privacy-enhancing tools. The company is also looking at releasing mobile versions of DNT+, as well as an Opera browser add-on. One of the potential complications in developing a mobile version of a tracking blocker will be getting approval from the operating system makers, which derive revenue from those same mobile ads.

Kerrigan concluded, ""From identity theft to the loss of employment, the consequences of consumer inertia on privacy are real.""",html
http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/check-out-the-macos-sierra-public-beta/,Check out the MacOS Sierra public beta,"July,Pm,Clifford Col",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"For the third July in a row, Apple is giving customers a prerelease version of the next Macintosh operating system, MacOS Sierra. The public beta is a chance for users to monitor the OS's progress and help the company identify issues before Sierra officially ships this fall.

You can download the test OS for free, but be aware that beta software -- even from Apple -- isn't fully baked: Apps may be unstable, features may not work as you expect, and you may come across bugs and software incompatibilities. You might want to skip the beta and wait for the finished OS. But if you just can't wait, take a few preliminary steps before you install and run the prerelease version of Sierra.

Can you run the Sierra public beta?

First, check that you can run the public beta. Apple says the Sierra preview should run on MacBooks and iMacs from late 2009 and later; and MacBook Airs, MacBook Pros, Mac Minis, and Mac Pros from 2010 and later.

Back up, then choose where to install Sierra

Next, make sure you have a good, current backup of your primary drive. This doesn't have to be a chore: See our guide to backing up your Mac for advice.

Consider installing the Sierra public beta on an external drive or a separate partition, not on your primary Mac drive. That way, if something goes wrong with the beta, or if you decide you want to return to El Capitan, rolling back will be much easier.

Download the MacOS Sierra public beta

If you can live with the potential quirks and glitches of beta software and have a current backup, you are ready.

The prerelease version of Sierra is available from Apple's public beta software page. You need an AppleID to join the beta program. After you sign in, click the MacOS tab and read the instructions.

As you scroll down, click the Redeem Code button. The Mac App Store should open and automatically apply your redemption code for the public beta.

The download is big -- around 5GB -- but once it finishes, follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation.

Apple says you will receive updates to the MacOS public beta through the Mac App Store when they are available.

Installing and uninstalling Sierra

According to Apple, in the fall you'll be able to install the final version of Sierra over the public beta. However, if you want to remove the beta before then and return to El Capitan, you'll need to first erase the beta software, then reinstall the latest shipping version of OS X 10.11, and then restore your apps and files from the backup you made.

Of course, if you wisely installed the prerelease version of Sierra on an external drive or separate partition, you can just restart with your primary drive.",html

Two key pieces of Google's effort to make Chrome a more competitive browser fell into place on Tuesday as Google released beta versions of the browser for Mac OS X and Linux.

Tuesday's software release is a version of Chrome that had previously been available only as developer preview software for Mac and Linux machines. ""It took longer than we expected, but we hope the wait was worth it,"" product manager Brian Rakowski said in a blog post.

Macs are widely used, if not as common as Windows machines, and there's been some demand in tech circles for the Mac version of Chrome. Linux, while less widely used among ordinary computer users, has importance of its own: it's the foundation for Chrome OS. That's the browser-based operating system Google hopes will be popular on Netbooks starting next year.

According to the Chromium development calendar, the beta versions are scheduled to graduate to the next level of maturity, ""stable,"" on January 12. Chrome for Windows graduated out of beta almost exactly a year ago.

Google doesn't emphasize product version numbers in the project, instead automatically delivering updates behind the scenes to the browser that take effect when it's restarted. But it does use version milestones to keep track of development internally.

The biggest new feature of Chrome 4.0 is support for extensions, which let people customize the browser. In the Mozilla world, they're called add-ons, and they've been a big part of Firefox's success.

Extensions aren't useful, though, unless people can find them. Google on Tuesday also launched a Chrome extensions gallery page.

There are more than 300 extensions available for Chrome, extensions programmers Aaron Boodman and Erik Kay said in a blog post.

However, extensions on the Mac aren't yet available, though they had been for a time in the developer-preview version. ""Extensions aren't quite beta-quality on Mac yet, but you will be able to preview them on a developer channel soon,"" Rakowski said.

Also on the Chrome for Mac to-do list: a bookmark manager, PDF viewing in the browser, bookmark synchronization, 64-bit support, and my personal favorite differentiator of Firefox 3.6 on the Mac, full-screen support.

Why try Chrome?

For those of you new to Chrome, here's a brief version of why it's my default browser on both Windows and, as of about a month ago, Mac OS X. Your preferences and needs may vary, of course, and I still use Firefox every day, too.

 Speed. It's fast to start up, though not quite as snappy as it once was now that it's not so bare-bones, and rivals are making progress. It's also fast loading Web pages and running JavaScript programs on them.

 Tabs. I spawn innumerable new tabs all day long, and when it takes a long time (I'm looking at you, Internet Explorer), I get infuriated. I also like the order in which new tabs arrive, a style Firefox is mimicking.

 The omnibox. It's a single bar that merges the utility of an address bar and search bar. I hit Ctrl-L (on Windows) or Command-L (on Mac) to pop my cursor up there, and start typing. One nice--if somewhat obscure--feature is fast site search on some domains, so for example I can type A, M, tab, and up pops an Amazon.com icon; what I type afterward is entered as a search on Amazon. That conveniently gets me straight to the search results so I don't have to see yet another Kindle ad.

 A minimal user interface. When browsing, I like my user interface to step aside and make way for the Web page. Scrolling was a wonderful innovation in computers a few decades ago, but I like to avoid it when I can. Chrome puts tabs in the real estate ordinarily devoted to a program's title bar and shuffles the menu controls off to the right of that tab strip (though the Mac version gets a regular menu bar).

Another potential perk: avant-garde Web technology, including WebGL and O3D for accelerated 3D graphics and Native Client for speeding up Web apps with direct access to a processor, are being built into Chrome. Another such Google project, Gears, is already built into Chrome--though Gears doesn't work on Mac OS X 10.6.

There are things you might miss--the full panoply of Firefox extensions, toolbars from Google or others, print preview. And the ""browser not supported"" error messages on various Web pages are annoying, though in my experience there's rarely an actual compatibility problem. Overall, I like it.

Is Google spying on me?

If you're worried about what new data Google will be able to harvest on you, I recommend a close read of Google's Chrome privacy page. This doesn't worry me much, but I may be insufficiently paranoid. In my opinion, the biggest thing is that Google stores 2 percent of the data it gathers when people type text into Chrome's combination search and address bar, called the omnibox.

That means Google can see not only what you're searching for (as it would for any Google search), but what Web site addresses you're typing as well. The data is anonymized within 24 hours, Google said.

Also, Chrome has a feature called DNS pre-fetching that tracks down the Internet server addresses on Web pages in anticipation that you'll be clicking links on the page. So Chrome--and Google, too, if you're using Google Public DNS--retrieves this information from the Internet.

The new JavaScript engine, including a compiler called IonMonkey, is designed to run Web-based programs faster and to impose less disruption during the pesky memory-scrubbing process called garbage collection. And the graphics engine, called Azure, is intended to get along better with Windows' graphics interfaces while still working with those of Mac OS X and Linux.

Says Joe Drew, who's working on Azure:

Firefox 4's graphics performance is great...We're not content with ""great,"" though, and our investigations into how to make drawing even faster have revealed that some of our choices in Gecko's graphics engine aren't optimal for performance.

Naturally, Azure is designed to improve the performance. It also lays the groundwork for future work in separating Mozilla processes into different memory compartments, a long-running project called Electrolysis. The compartmentalization has the potential to improve security and performance, but it requires extensive retooling of basic parts of the browser.

The browser market has become hotly competitive, with Google's Chrome stealing away share of usage once held by Mozilla's Firefox and IE9 finally giving Microsoft a competitive browser again. Responding to the challenge, Mozilla has put Firefox on a Chrome-esque development fast track to try to get new features into people's hands faster.

The next version, Firefox 5, is due June 21, according to release manager Christian Legnitto. But don't expect the JavaScript and graphics changes to arrive that soon.

""IonMonkey is currently in the design stages--David Anderson and I are studying the compiler literature and the competition and doing experiments to find out just what features IonMonkey needs. Coding is about to start,"" said David Mandelin, a Mozilla JavaScript engine programmer. Compilers handle the essential task of translating the programs a human wrote into the instructions a computer understands.

The new JavaScript engine also is due to get a new debugging interface. That's potentially important: JavaScript programs are steadily increasing in sophistication and size, and tracking down why something isn't working is crucial for programmer productivity.

And, more to the point, all the browser makers are trying furiously to court Web developers with features to make their lives easier. Web developers are the ones who ensure a Web site or Web application works on multiple browsers and takes advantages of new features.",html

Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, Chrome dev 7.0.503.0 comes accompanied only by minor bug fixes.

There are some small tweaks to the Wrench options menu on Mac, and IP addresses typed into the location bar work when browsing in offline mode. There are several anticipated changes planned for Chrome 7 that either haven't yet been implemented yet or require manual activation. These include the Native Client support for Web apps, which can be activated with the command line flag ""--enable-nacl"". Mac and Linux users will need to include ""--no-sandbox"". Google recommends only using this to test the Native Client feature, and not for standard Web browsing. While the company doesn't specify why, it's reasonable to speculate that disabling the sandbox is something that will decrease the average user's security.

Bugs are nothing new to the developers version of Chrome, which is intended to be a rougher version of the browser than the beta or stable channels. A new bug indicates that the new developers version is incompatible with streaming Netflix movies, while another appears to be affecting the rendering of extension fonts. Some users are reporting that the search function in the location bar is no longer working for them, although that doesn't appear to be affecting all users at this time. Because these bugs are in the developers version, it's expected that they'll get fixed before the beta and stable versions receive updates.

One interesting bug from the previous version of Chrome dev that introduced a severe security risk in conjunction with the LastPass encrypted password manager extension was repaired in the new version. Google did not mention this in its changelog.",html

HotSpot Shield maker AnchorFree has built an extra wall of protection into its popular virtual private network software, available today. The update adds a malware site guard to the VPN client without requiring you to download a new version of the program because the changes have all been made on the server, not on your computer.

With the anti-malware site guard in place, HotSpot Shield will throw up a warning like the one you see in the screenshot above. Available on Windows (download), Mac (download), and iOS (download), the new anti-malware site protection is based off a database of more than 3 million malicious sites. Between the three operating systems, AnchorFree says that HotSpot Shield has more than 10 million active monthly users. Since the site guard is implemented on the server-side, it will be available in the coming HotSpot Shield Android app, too.

For people who use the free, ad-supported version of HotSpot Shield, the new guard will block malware sites. If you upgrade to the ad-free and bandwidth-prioritized Elite version, you will also receive protection against three additional types of passive Web threats. These include otherwise safe sites that have been infected by third-party malware, phishing sites, and sites that promulgate spam.

AnchorFree CEO David Gorodyansky said during a phone call on Tuesday that the update makes HotSpot Shield a complete secure browsing solution. ""There was no issue for us in integrating the secure browsing with the VPN.""

When I tested it, the updated Elite version worked well. There was no lag time where the malicious site appeared to resolve before being blocked. And in fact, the way the new protections work is to prevent that site from even loading in the first place. Instead, what you're shown below the warning is a screenshot of the site.

There are two options in the upper right corner of a blocked page. The first takes you to a little-known search engine called Search-Results.com, that appears to have a referral deal with Anchor Free. While that makes sense from a business perspective, a link to the browser's default search engine would've been more polite. Search-results.com is also known for paying companies that install proprietary toolbars to have them change your default search engine. That's not happening here, thankfully.

Below that is a link to go to the real site, though for obvious safety reasons AnchorFree doesn't recommend you click on it. I perceived no lag in loading either known malicious sites or known safe ones.",html

While not everything they showed off is quite ready for the public yet, we do have some initial thoughts on the announced updates.

Offline Google Maps for Mobile

Even though I haven't played with this feature yet, I can already say Offline Maps is going to be hugely useful. Travelers especially should be ecstatic, as they will be able to cache specific areas and boot up Google Maps while traipsing around the globe (without any network connection, mind you). What's more, GPS-enabled devices will still be able to plot your location with a blue dot on the map, even sans network, according to Rita Chen, product manager of Google Maps for mobile. Oh, and the compass will work as well, which should make orienting yourself that much easier. All that said, this is very likely going to change the way we travel.

But not only for travelers, Offline Maps might be a good way to save battery as well. Of course, we'd have to do some testing first, but I'm guessing that pulling up a cached map might be more battery-friendly than accessing one through an active network connection. If that's the case, I can see users caching maps for all of their most frequently visited destinations (storage space permitting, of course).

For those who may not recall, this feature was actually being tested through Google Labs in July of last year. Back then, though, it was called ""Download map area,"" and it limited you to only a 10-mile radius. Also, it only stored the base map tiles and landmarks on the map, which meant all of Google Maps' other features still required a data connection.

For me, this raises a few questions regarding this newest iteration of downloadable maps. For instance, what are the limitations of Offline Maps? Will offline navigation be available? Also, does the feature cache local data, like the newly incorporated Zagat reviews? Will there be a setting to have it do so, perhaps? We'll find out in the coming weeks, when the offline maps feature is expected to be available to Android users.

Google Street View Trekker

Also announced today was quite possibly the nerdiest backpack in existence, Google's Street View Trekker. Cumbersome appearance aside, this bad boy is important. No, it's not going to be available to consumers anytime soon (thank goodness). In fact, its existence isn't even going to add anything new to Google Maps' feature set. Rather, the Google Street View Trekker is important because it will refine Street View coverage even further. A lot further. As Luc Vincent, engineering director of Google Maps, demonstrated, it will make it possible for us to eventually get ""Street Views"" of undrivable areas like ski trails. Not to mention the countless miles of hiking trails, national parks, and so on.

(Credit: Josh Lowensohn/CNET)

What's probably more important, though, are all of the alleyways and unpaved paths that are common in developing countries around the world. With an army of Google Street View Trekkers running around, Google's powers of mapping and navigation will very soon be usable by a lot more people.

Google Earth in 3D

And as widely expected, today Google showed off 3D imaging powers. What wasn't exactly expected, though, was that these powers would be available through Google Earth on mobile devices (not Google Maps).

Said to be available for ""a few major cities for Android and iOS in the coming weeks,"" this newfangled 3D functionality allows you to virtually swoop around cityscapes like Iron Man (almost). And it's a lot more detailed (and stunning) than the textured buildings that have graced Google Earth since 2006. To say the least, the advanced 3D-rendering technology that Google demonstrated was impressive, and I, for one, am excited to get my hands on it.

(Credit: Josh Lowensohn/CNET)

While the 3D views are undoubtedly something to behold, I'm not sure how many people will actually enjoy them on a regular basis at this point. I myself have only used Google Earth on my phone a handful of times. On my tablet, I've used it a bit more. That said, I think this is yet another sign of an imminent convergence of Maps and Earth. From a user-experience perspective, if I'm looking at an area in Google Maps, it doesn't make much sense for me to have to boot up Google Earth in order to get a 3D view of that same area. So, what do you say we just merge these two already?",html

You can download Firefox 7 Beta for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android.

The performance improvements are the first major performance changes for Firefox after a summer of complaints from a small yet vocal minority that was experiencing severe memory leaks and crashes. The company is anticipating around a 30 percent gain in performance that derives from changes to the JavaScript garbage collector, implementing Azure Direct2D for Canvas, and adding developer support for a Web timing specification and a CSS3 Text-Overflow option. Password and bookmark changes and additions made in Firefox Sync will synchronize faster, too, according to Mozilla.

If you wish to contribute performance data on Firefox to Mozilla, there's a new add-on called Telemetry (download from Mozilla add-on site) that chips in your experiences to Firefox developers.

Many of the same changes made in the desktop version have been made to the Firefox Beta for Android. These include the optimized memory use, restoring session history and tabs, changes to Firefox Sync, copy and paste from mobile Web sites, and enhanced language detection for localization.

For people who don't like some of Firefox's recent changes to the address bar, I just discovered that there are two new entries in the about:config menu. In Firefox 7 and above, you can force the page's protocol to always be displayed by changing browser.urlbar.trimURLs to False. In Firefox 6 and above, you can disable domain name highlighting by changing browser.urlbar.formatting.enabled to False, too.

http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20022022-264.html,Browser underdog Opera fights for survival,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"OSLO, Norway--Opera Software, the scrappy Norwegian browser maker, today faces arguably the biggest competitive threats of its 15-year history.

Stephen Shankland/CNET

The first challenges are on personal computers. Right after Google's Chrome burst onto the scene two years ago, Opera slipped from fourth to fifth place in browser usage worldwide. And longtime archrival Microsoft is no longer the punching bag of the browser market; its forthcoming IE9 is a serious attempt to match rivals in performance and support for new Web standards.

Second, in Opera's other domain, Apple's iPhone and now Google's Android are rewriting the mobile browsing rules. Their browsers are adapted for phones more like miniature desktop computers than the small-screened, candy bar-shape models that prevailed when Opera's mobile browsing business began.

And yet the Oslo underdog has adapted to crises before and appears to be adapting to the present changes as well.

In a series of interviews at its headquarters here, Opera executives showed they suffer no illusions about the competition. They also made a credible case that Opera, while not about to dethrone its bigger rivals, will continue to defend its turf with a profitable business.

A new mobile strategy

One cornerstone of its confidence comes from a major shift in its mobile strategy in response to a dark, unprofitable patch in the second half of 2009. Opera shifted its alliance efforts from phone companies to the powerful network operators who see their future threatened by the new generation of smartphones and services.

Opera

""We're taking bigger bets on operators because they need us more than bigger handset operators,"" said CEO Lars Boilesen. Phone makers' expansion into operating systems, applications, and app stores threaten to demote carriers to mere ""dumb pipes,"" but Opera's software can help maintain those carriers' customer relationships.

And so far, the shift is paying off for the browser company. For one thing, Opera has more engineers to devote to the core products--Opera Mini and Opera Mobile--because the company is delivering the same branded browser to carrier partners rather than variations of an unbranded browser to phone makers. For another, the carriers pay recurring fees based on active users, not the one-time, up-front payment of phone makers.

The result: revenue from operators has increased to $9 million in the second quarter of 2010, up from about $7.1 million two quarters earlier.

Revenue from Opera's desktop browser, which runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux and comes with a money-making search box leading to Google or other search engines, helped prop up the finances during the mobile transition. And a newer business--browsers on Net-connected TVs and set-top boxes--also is increasing.

Overall, the company's second-quarter net income was a $3.3 million--less than a rounding error at its competitors but enough profit to keep the company in its niche.

Stephen Shankland/CNET

A 15-year Opera

Opera was founded June 22, 1995, though its roots extend to a research project begun in 1994 at Telenor, Norway's largest telecommunications company. It remains in the same Oslo building that's housed it for years, even as its neighbors--search company Fast Search and Transfer, developer toolmaker Troll Tech, and videoconfercing specialist Tandberg--sold to Microsoft, Nokia, and Cisco Systems, respectively.

It's very far from the U.S. software industry--geographically and culturally. Even with fierce competition from overseas rivals, several Opera employees took pride in a work-life balance at odds with the Silicon Valley ethos.

And yet it's not only eked out a living, persisting as browser efforts from IBM, Symantec, Sun Microsystems, and Netscape fell by the wayside, it's actually won a measure of influence.

Opera helped keep the fires of Web development burning during the dark years when Microsoft's Internet Explorer grew dormant after winning the browser wars of the 1990s and when standards groups were fruitlessly focused on dead-end XHTML technology. It won a band of loyal users who help to promote the browser, eagerly pointing out that innovations such as tabbed browsing, a built-in search box, Web page thumbnails on the new-tab page originated at Opera. It's secured some helpful geographic strongholds such as Russia. And its mobile browser products top the market even as the headlines go to Apple.

Partly through its standards-group work, Opera punches above its weight in the industry. Its independent support can help new technology such as Google's WebM for video streaming or Mozilla's Web Open Font Format get off the ground, for example. And its chief technology officer, Håkon Wium Lie, worked with Web founder Tim Berners-Lee and founded the Web formatting technology called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) that's now one of the hottest areas of Web design.

Stephen Shankland/CNET

Perhaps surprisingly, the company now employs 700 people, and 80 percent of them are engineers. The vast majority of people don't use Opera's products, but those who do now number more than 140 million.

Those engineers are working on cramming features into Opera. Its new version 11 for desktop machines, though still in alpha testing, will be an important test as Opera adds extensions to customize the browser and match rivals' hardware acceleration, according to Lars Erik Bolstad, vice president of core technology. Those programmers also are building hardware acceleration into Opera Mini and Mobile so, for example, pinch-to-zoom and scrolling work smoothly on capable phones

Real threats

The competitive threats are real, though. Even as Opera hangs on to its slice of browser market, three of its competitors--Apple, Google, and Microsoft--are tech giants with powerful global brands and tremendous financial resources. The fourth, Mozilla, rose from the ashes of Netscape with Firefox. It, not Opera, is the independent browser that grew to the top alternative to the browser built into Windows.

All these competitors are pouring development funds into their browsers as the market takes on new importance. The increasing power of Web applications such as Google Docs and Facebook means customers spend ever more time working and living within the frame of a browser window.

data from Net Applications; chart by Stephen Shankland/CNET

And Opera isn't at the top of Web developers' priority lists. Web standards mean compatibility isn't as hard as it once was, but it's still a huge problem. The deluge of new technologies, some essentially trial versions of what might become standards, make it worse.

""I always feel Opera is the Rodney Dangerfield of browsers. They get no respect,"" said Brad Neuberg, who's worked on many Web projects at Google including Google Docs and Gears before striking off to begin a start-up trying to capitalize on HTML5 and related Web technologies.

""There's a clunkiness to it,"" Neuberg added. ""The technical underpinnings are amazing,"" but Opera needs a user experience experts to ""make it feel like a joy to use.""

On the mobile side, development is on fire with the new generation of smartphones. Even though native applications are a dominant means of tapping into network services on iOS and Android devices, mobile browsing use also is growing at a healthy rate.

Opera

Notably, iOS's Safari and Android's built-in browser are both based on the same open-source engine, WebKit. As notably, so is the browser in Hewlett-Packard's WebOS for Palm phones, Samsung's Bada mobile operating system, and the browser coming to new BlackBerry devices. WebKit has proven a unifying, empowering force in mobile browsing.

Indeed, it was WebKit that whacked Opera's unbranded browser business.

Mobile choices

Opera sees room for others--hardly a surprise given that about 70 percent of its revenue comes from mobile compared with about 30 percent for its desktop browser. It's adapting its two browsers--Mini and Mobile--to keep its business humming despite the smartphone market upheaval.

First, a primer on what separates the two. Opera Mini, the company's first mobile browser, is geared for wimpier hardware. To handle pages on a Web steadily growing more complicated, Mini uses Opera servers to read the Web pages, boil them down into a compressed state, then send them to the display vessel that is Mini. It makes money for Opera when the company customizes it to put carrier-preferred shortcuts on the ""speed dial"" quick-launch page--for example a Vodafone offer for two free weeks of Internet access in Egypt--and can share in resulting revenue.

Opera Mobile, in contrast, is a full-fledged browser based on the same engine that runs on the desktop version of Opera. That means it works on interactive Web applications where Opera Mini often struggles or fails. It's available on Nokia's Symbian operating system, among other areas, and tomorrow is set to arrive in beta form on Android.

Stephen Shankland/CNET

The Android product will bring the revenue-sharing business model of the desktop browser to new mobile users, said Christen Krogh, Opera's chief development officer. ""We want because we think the consumer monetization model we're helping bring about on mobile is going to be really lucrative,"" Krogh said. Opera came out ahead when in 2005 it moved from charging for the Opera desktop browser itself to getting a fraction of online transactions such as clicking on search ads that its browser helped facilitate.

""We think that model is going to be really lucrative in mobile,"" Krogh said.

Like Opera for the desktop, Opera Mobile got a turbo mode that can use the Opera servers for a speed boost when networks are strained.

""We are living in a bubble,"" in first-world countries with disposable income and fast networks, said Jon S. von Tetzchner, Opera's co-founder and until the end of last year chief executive. Opera's browsers are designed to reach the rest of the world as well, and that is where a huge amount of growth for Internet services is taking place.

And while the smartphone revolution is real, he said, so is the growth of lesser models. Moore's Law, broadly speaking, has enabled powerful hardware in high-end smartphones, but that's not the only change it's brought to the mobile market.

""Instead of something twice as powerful, you're actually seeing a more reasonable price,"" von Tetzchner said. ""They cut the cost instead."" Such lower-cost handsets are often the staples in areas such as India where mobile phones, not PCs, are the dominant way people tap into the Net.

Opera

Turbo time

""When CPUs get faster, we want to do hardware acceleration as much as the next guy, but we also want to do the harder optimization--what do you do when the device is almost crawling?"" von Tetzchner said. ""From a programmer challenge point of view, that's a much harder problem.""

And it's still relevant in the rich part of the world, where network connections often are overtaxed even where high-speed networks have arrived. Opera Mini and Opera Mobile can also cut data usage for the large number of people without unlimited data plans.

The service is widely used; Opera just opened a new data center in Iceland to support 20 million Opera Mini users in Europe, Africa, and Asia. It's not easy to run at scale, as browser maker Skyfire showed when its new browser application for streaming Flash to the iPhone overwhelmed its servers.

Carriers like it the turbo service because it gives them precise visibility into statistics such as how people use the Net, for example letting them gauge how likely people are to need more lucrative higher-end data subscription plans.

""We give them precise analytics of Opera users on the network,"" Boilesen said.

Opera

Also, through a 2010 acquisition of Californian mobile ad network AdMarvel, Opera has the ability to feed ads efficiently into the billions of Web pages it delivers through its servers. It's not a lot of revenue today, but Opera expects growth.

But Opera still needs to work on its turbo mode, Boilesen said--starting with visibility.

""We have not really successfully launched turbo,"" he said. ""We don't need to relaunch it, but we need to get people to try turbo on phones.""

In the big picture, being a gateway to tens of millions of people's usage of the Web is indeed a powerful position. The company just needs to figure the best way to accommodate Web applications, avoid abuses of its privileged role, and extract money from the role most effectively.

""I think it's interesting times for Opera,"" Boilesen said. ""We have something nobody else has.""",html

Like the last version, the free RealPlayer SP (which stands for ""social and portable"") lets you rip streaming Flash videos from the Web to your hard drive. What's new: you can also transcode them into appropriate formats for playback on portable devices. If you're using an iPod or iPhone, the RealPlayer will even generously insert the transcoded version directly into your iTunes library.

CNET's John Falcone has already done aof the RealPlayer SP beta, but I was intrigued enough to try it myself. My first thought was to rip YouTube videos, but then I realized that it's much more convenient simply to use the built-in YouTube icon on my iPhone to stream them directly to the phone (as long as I've got a wireless connection, which I usually do).

Then I remembered that one of the best features of Microsoft's new Bing search engine, which launched earlier this month, is its video search. (The predecessor to Bing, Live Search, had most of the same video search features as well.) There's nothing wrong with Google's video search, but I personally prefer the Bing interface, and I like the way the video is previewed right in the search results.

Using them together was a breeze--once installed, the RealPlayer automatically adds a small pop-up message to any embedded video in your browser (I tested it with both Internet Explorer and Firefox), asking you if you want to download the video. Transcoding takes a few minutes, particularly for long videos, but in the last half-hour I've managed to rip the new Grizzly Bear video, the reunited Pink Floyd's entire Live 8 performance, and a live version of Ozzy's ""Crazy Train"" with Randy Rhoads into iTunes in both video (H.264) and audio-only (MP3) formats. All came from different original sources, but all were available through Bing.

I'm particularly impressed with the RealPlayer's video-to-audio transcoder--my 8GB iPhone is way too small to fit a lot of videos on it, and transcoding video to audio files has been a bit of a hassle in the past. Now I can do it on the fly, as I download them. Kudos to RealNetworks on a nice piece of software.

https://www.cnet.com/how-to/six-ways-to-make-your-iphone-more-secure/,Six ways to make your iPhone more secure,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"I lost my iPhone over Thanksgiving weekend. I eventually found it in my wife's car, which I never drive but did on Thanksgiving ever so briefly when we were juggling cars in the driveway with my parents visiting for the holiday.

Long story short: it was a very disconcerting feeling and one I'd rather not experience again soon. Because I'm lazy (one word for it), I didn't have a passcode set up on my iPhone, which meant that anyone that may have come across my phone would have had unfettered access to my emails, texts, photos and other information. Thankfully, I set up Find my iPhone and was able to use that security feature to lock my phone remotely.

Even though my story ended happily with my iPhone safely returned after never actually having left my yard, I learned a few lessons during the process of losing my iPhone for a few days.

1. Use a passcode

I now use a passcode. The standard passcode for iOS 9 is a six-digit passcode, though you can increase the strength of the passcode by choosing an alphanumeric passcode or a numeric passcode longer than six digits. You can also move in the opposite direction and choose a four-digit passcode, which was the default option prior to iOS 9. (Even if you set up Touch ID to use your fingerprint to unlock your iPhone, you'll still need a passcode for times when your finger is sweaty or wet or otherwise can't be read by your iPhone's fingerprint scanner.)

Enlarge Image Screenshot by Matt Elliott/CNET

To turn on a passcode, head to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode. Tap Turn Passcode On and enter a six-digit code. To downgrade to a more convenient but less secure four-digit passcode or a stronger custom passcode, tap Change Passcode and then tap Passcode Options.

2. Disable lock screen options

Even if you have a rock-solid passcode, a nefarious individual can still get into your phone via the lock screen. In her efforts to be helpful, Siri can share too much information from the lock screen, freely displaying personal information to whomever finds your lost phone. If this thought scares you, then it's best to disable Siri from the lock screen.

Enlarge Image Screenshot by Matt Elliott/CNET

To do so, head to back to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode and toggle the slider switch to off for Siri in the Allow Access When Locked list. You may also want to disable Wallet, which will force you to unlock your phone before paying via Apple Pay. Also, the Today and Notifications view options will prevent those screens appearing from the Notification Center when your phone is locked. And the Reply with Message prevents someone from replying to a text on your phone without first unlocking it.

3. Make your iPhone lock sooner

If you leave your iPhone behind in a restaurant, bus or another public place, someone could act quickly and get into your phone before your passcode is required. You can set your passcode to be required after a certain amount of time has passed since you last unlocked your phone so that you aren't constantly being asked to punch in your passcode each time you attempt to get into your phone. You can set it up to four hours, which is on the convenient end of the convenience vs. security spectrum.

This setting can be found on the Touch ID & Passcode page of Settings. The most secure option is to set Require Passcode to Immediately, which will require you or anyone who picks up your phone to enter your passcode no matter how long ago your last unlocked your phone.

4. Disable Control Center on lock screen

Another way hackers can get into your iPhone or at least buy some time to find a way to circumvent your passcode is to enable Airplane mode via Control Center from the lock screen. Once it's in Airplane mode, you won't be able to track it via Find my iPhone.

To prevent Control Center from being accessible from the lock screen, head to Settings > Control Center and toggle the slider off for Access on Lock Screen.

5. Turn on Find My iPhone

Even if you have ignored the first four steps here, I implore you to enable Find My iPhone. It doesn't add any inconvenience in the day-to-day operation of your iPhone and is easy to set up. With it enabled, you can track your lost device from another iOS device or your computer, seeing where your iPhone is on a map. You can also play sound on your lost phone to aid your search efforts (which turns out isn't helpful when your phone is locked in a car in your driveway). And if you really aren't having any luck with locating your iPhone, Find My iPhone lets you lock your iPhone and also remotely erase its data.

To turn on Find My iPhone, go to Settings > iCloud. Tap on Find My iPhone and toggle the switch on for Find My iPhone.

6. Set up two-step verification

For this last tip, I'll turn it over to Jason Cipriani, who previously wrote about how to enable set up two-step verification for your Apple ID. Two-step verification protects the data you have stored with Apple, including photos and files in iCloud and payment information for iTunes. With two-step verification enabled, someone would need another of your devices to get into your account even if they had managed to get a hold of your password.",html

The Smithsonian's ""Art of Video Games"" exhibit has now closed, but games will be on display at another high-profile art museum beginning early next year.

New York's Museum of Modern Art has announced that it's chosen 40 games to display at a new game-specific gallery.

Games selected for display at MoMA go back decades and include the likes of Pac-Man and Spacewar, but also contemporary releases such as Portal and Minecraft.

The games will be on display as part of the museum's Architecture and Design collection at the establishment's Johnson Galleries beginning in March of next year.

""Are video games art? They sure are, but they are also design, and a design approach is what we chose for this new foray into this universe,"" reads a line from the Museum of Modern Art's announcement.

As with many tech code-names, MemShrink doesn't sound particularly exciting. And yet, the memory leak-managing project at Mozilla finally sees some of its biggest changes reach the vast majority of people using Firefox with today's major update.

Mozilla expects that the new Firefox 15 for PCs (download for Windows | Mac | Linux) finally will put an end to the multitude of memory-managing issues that have plagued Firefox for years. As we noted in July when Firefox 15 went beta, the MemShrink project has spent much of its time fixing how the browser handles add-ons that contribute to memory problems. A ""memory leak"" is when a program destabilizes itself after grabbing memory to use for a task, but then unsuccessfully or improperly releases that memory after the task is done. Firefox engineers claimed that the browser had rid itself of many of these problems, but add-ons and lengthy browser sessions still contributed leaks.

This update, they say, addresses those leaks. In my ongoing use of Firefox alpha and beta builds, there are notably fewer crashes with Firefox 15. Whether the changes are enough to coax back people who've abandoned Firefox over the past few years is another matter entirely.

Firefox 15 has built-in PDF support, but it's still not turned on by default. However, there is now native support for the Opus audio codec, an open-source format that offers better compression than MP3, Ogg, or AAC; and SPDY version 3 compliance, an update to Google's networking protocol.

Web developers and especially game developers get some changes in Firefox 15, too, including a JavaScript debugger, an event timer, WebGL improvements, and JavaScript just-in-time (JIT) engine improvements for faster browsing. Also in Firefox 15 is support for compressed textures for better video memory use. Mozilla has prepared a demo to show what compressed textures can do.

The revamped and faster interface that arrived in Firefox 15 for Android (download) works on tablets as of this update. This includes a new start page, which Mozilla calls the Awesome Screen; the new layout; dramatically faster page-load times; and Flash support on Honeycomb, which was a big factor in delaying the launch of the tablet version.

Firefox for Android autodetects your device and installs the proper interface without any additional input required.

The Android version of Firefox on all devices now has a Menu option for jumping to a site's desktop view; closing tabs with a swipe; and searching within a page. The Download Manager lets you pause, resume, cancel, and retry a failed download; you can toggle which data to clear from Settings; and you can import your bookmarks and history from the default Android browser. Under-the-hood improvements include the new Opus, and SPDY v3.

The short rundown on Firefox 15 for Android is that it now very closely approximates many of the core features in Firefox for desktops.

Acknowledging the chaos it caused by pushing out a buggy antivirus update on Wednesday, McAfee apologized to its customers in the form of a late-night blog on Thursday.

Barry McPherson, executive vice president of support and customer service, issued the apology on behalf of McAfee, saying the company was sorry for the headaches it caused for so many customers.

At 6 a.m. PDT Wednesday, the company released a faulty update to its antivirus software that hosed computers running Windows XP with Service Pack 3. The update, a DAT file, misidentified a key Windows file called svchost.exe as a virus, causing PCs to crash or keep rebooting. The problem affected customers worldwide, including chipmaker Intel, Rhode Island hospitals, Kentucky police, University of Michigan's medical school, and an Australian supermarket chain

In response, McAfee staffers have been working around the clock to help customers get their systems back online, McPherson said. The company believes most impacted PCs are back up.

He also detailed the fix that McAfee quickly patched together for early Thursday morning. The SuperDAT Remediation Tool stifles the updated driver that creates the false positive and then restores the svchost.exe file. McAfee said support reps are available for anyone who needs further help.

How did this problem occur in the first place? The short answer: poor testing. McAfee recently changed its quality assurance process, leading to the buggy DAT file to get past the test environment and onto the PCs of customers, MacPherson said.

To help ensure this doesn't happen again, McAfee will add new QA steps to address any update that directly affects crucial Windows system files. McPherson also said the company will beef up its Artemis system, which provides users with cloud-based virus identification, to include a more comprehensive list of Windows system files to leave alone.

McPherson closed his blog with another apology. ""Again, on behalf of McAfee, I'm very sorry for how you may have been impacted by the faulty DAT file update and thank you for your continued support and cooperation as we work to remediate the situation,"" he said.

Will the apology and fix be enough to soothe angry customers? Based on some of the comments to the Thursday-night blog and to another McPherson blog on Wednesday, that may not be so easy.

Among the more than 100 comments to the Wednesday blog, a large number vented about lost hours of business and productivity and a lack of confidence in McAfee. Many also disparaged a company claim that the problem affected only a small number of customers.

There were only a few comments to the Thursday blog at press time, but a couple made their frustration clear.

""First of all let me say I am glad we have switched nearly 75 percent of our clients away from your product prior to this happening,"" wrote one commenter. ""I can't imagine the chaos if we hadn't. It was chaos enough for us running all over town and billing our clients for a software glitch on a program that we recommended to them.""

Wrote another: ""If you expect customers to buy your product you...better make sure what you release is as solid as a rock. You shouldn't be on the list of risky software downloads!""",html

Best known to a younger generation as Detective Odafin ""Fin"" Tutuola on ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,"" Ice-T originally felt more at home on the other side of the law, committing crimes and later writing lyrics about them. His most controversial song, recorded with with his band Body Count, is ""Cop Killer,"" a polarizing track released between the Rodney King beating and the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Body Count's latest album, ""Manslaughter,"" came out earlier this month, and the band will promote it on the Rockstar Mayhem Festival tour. I chatted with Ice-T about the ""Cop Killer"" controversy, being an OG, recovering from the loss of his parents and a horrific car accident, playing the law and outlaws, and his favorite apps.

What can you tell us about the new Body Count album?

It's hardcore Ice-T. I think it's lyrically one of my best records. You gotta go test it out. It might be too toxic for a lot of soft people. Body Count is grindhouse, ultraviolence, ultrasexual, but it's meant to be taken with a grain of salt. It's funny. It's so outrageous. But I am striking on a lot of issues that need to be addressed today. You're either gonna love it, or you're gonna hate it. It's not much in between.

Why is it called ""Manslaughter""?

""Manslaughter"" is my take on the death of manhood or the pussy-fication of the male sex right now. I think men are so afraid. They want to be politically correct with all this social media, where everyone's afraid to offend somebody 'cause you might get unfollowed or something devastating like that. So no one's talking about anything. I'm just trying to put some balls back in the game.

You recently posted on Twitter that you have to see Body Count live to understand what you're doing. What did you mean by that?

I don't really make music for radio. I make music to be performed. I think you have to be there and around the crowd to get the energy. It's a very aggressive situation, and it's always going to be more intense looking me in the face than listening on a speaker. Most people today listen to music over their laptop speakers, so I think the experience is tenfold when you get to see us live.

What will you bring to Mayhem Festival, musically and performance-wise?

I think we'll be different. We're very hardcore and aggressive, and all of our music is made for the mosh pit, so there should be a lot of action. I just think we bring a different sound. When I go to a concert with a lot of bands, I think the worst thing is to see a band that sounds like all the other bands. I think Body Count gives people a different sound to rock to.

Both of your parents died when you were fairly young. Outside of what I'd imagine to be an incredible sense of loss, how did that impact the course of your life?

I think when you're an orphan, you're very aware that no one has to give you anything. All that sense of entitlement goes out the window. I'm very much about knowing that if I hit the bottom, there's no one there whose duty is to pick me up. I don't have a mother or a father obligated to help me, so I've always been very self-sufficient and take care of myself. That doesn't mean that I don't live close to the edge, though. I'm not afraid to spend my last dollar, but I'm also aware that I've got to be able to make more money or support myself. It's very odd now, for someone who's an orphan to have so many people that depend on me. It's different. It's a real flip of the coin.

I've read that it was your cousin Earl, who originally introduced you to rock music when you were a teenager. What was it about that experience that spurred your interest in the genre?

It was forced on me. I couldn't change his radio, and he listened to nothing but rock, and actually thought he was Jimi Hendrix, walking around, wearing scarves and shit on his head. Music is an acquired taste, so once you can't listen to anything else, you start to pick the songs out that you like. If you work at a job, where all they play is reggae, eventually you start picking out the songs that you like. I just got indoctrinated to everything from Black Sabbath to Blue Oyster Cult to Def Leppard, and I tended to like the harder stuff like Black Sabbath.

Body Count covered ""Hey Joe"" for a Jimi Hendrix tribute album. Why that song, and in which ways do you identify with Hendrix?

Well, Jimi Hendrix was a bad motherfu*ker, and probably one of the baddest that ever lived -- just the way he used feedback and the musicianship. His lyrics were there. Sometimes you didn't know what he was singing. All that stuff was just so dope. We did ""Hey Joe"" because we thought it was the furthest from Body Count musically. I'm really into doing the unexpected. It's the opposite of us, but the content of the song, this guy who killed this woman because she was fu*king around, and now he's on the run, that's very Body Count.

You've served in the Army and play a detective on TV, yet you also have a criminal past and reject authority. How do you reconcile the two?

No reconciliation whatsoever. When you're a criminal, you're breaking the law. When you stop breaking the law, you're an honest citizen. You do what you have to do at that particular moment. I have no allegiance to crime. It was just a job occupation. And I'm not a cop; I can't arrest anybody, so I'm not really connected to the politics of police. I'm just an actor and enjoying the opportunities presented to me in my short life here. Who the hell wouldn't want to act in a movie?

What caused your car accident in the mid-1980s, and how did that change you?

The car accident just happened from hanging out too late. I was out at a club that didn't close till 9 o'clock in the morning, and I walked out of the club at 7 a.m., and my eyes are stinging and I've been up too late. It was sleep deprivation. I was dozing off at the intersection, letting my eyes rest, and at one of the particular intersections, I didn't wake up. I fell totally asleep. My foot fell off the break, and I coasted right into the intersection. I got side-hit dead in the driver's door and am lucky to be alive.

As a Crips affiliate, once you started becoming famous, were you still able to freely travel around LA, or were there certain gang areas that you could no longer go to?

I kinda had diplomatic immunity in LA. I was most closely connected to the Rollin 60's Neighborhood Crips, but by not being an active gang member and by being a rapper, everyone kinda liked me, because I represented LA. I kinda put LA on the map, so I had diplomatic immunity. That doesn't mean that nothing could happen to me. And to this day, when I'm in different areas of LA, I don't hang there too long. You gotta know somebody from that neighborhood. Even now I could be more of a target, 'cause they could think that I have money and want to rob me. You never get too cocky about south central LA. I could stand outside and get shot. Anybody can.

Your 1988 ""Colors"" single is one of your most famous. How accurate was the ""Colors"" film at portraying gang life?

Not really that accurate, because in ""Colors"" you had the blacks fighting the Mexicans, which had never really happened in LA. A Mexican-black war would be devastating in LA. Mexican gangs just messed with the Mexicans, and the blacks messed with the blacks. It was more of a show to let people know that there were gangs in Los Angeles, because when we got ready to make the movie, Dennis Hopper wanted to shoot in LA, and they wanted to shoot it in Chicago, because people were unaware there were gangs in LA. That year, there were 365 [gang-related] murders in LA. It had just never hit the press.

A lot of people have called themselves OG. What does it take to be a true OG? An OG is just slang for first generation. It means you started something that wasn't there. In gang vernacular, it would be the first generation of the gang. Now there are so many sects in LA. New gangs pop up every month. Now if I were to see someone who started a certain sect, I'd consider them an OG.

I started getting called an OG because I'm the OG of gangster rap, because I was able to put the guns and the gangs in the records. So I used the gang terminology to connect to hip-hop. But OG also means anything that's original, the original Chuck Taylors, the original 501 jeans. So if you've been in the game long enough, you could be considered OG, as opposed to a new booty-ass motherfu*ker that just got in the game.

What was the hardest part of the ""Cop Killer"" controversy for you?

I think just getting blindsided by it. We weren't prepared for the controversy. We didn't expect the controversy. We thought it was a rock record. We had played that record for a year on Lollapalooza and were business as usual. And all of a sudden, all this bullshit happens. I think we just weren't prepared for all the controversy and all the unnecessary bullshit that went along with the hype.

Rap has morphed from gangster rap to party music. What is the legacy of gangster rap?

I just think that it's an apolitical music, where we didn't give a fu*k. We had to say what we wanted to say. It was punk rock. It was, ""This is how I feel, and fu*k you, if you don't agree with it."" It's not based on money or fashion. It's all based on attitude, and we had to come from zero, like Dr. Dre and all of us -- there were no record labels, there was no help whether we liked it or not. Now, Dr. Dre is a successful entrepreneur, and the kids are able to start at a position that wasn't available to us, so they're definitely coming from a better place, and the music reflects that. It's softer and about partying. But gangster rap was necessary. I think conscious music is necessary. It's hard to be a gangster when you don't have to be.

You've played characters on both sides of the law. Which are more fun to play?

I don't like playing cops. I think when you cast me, and you cast a street guy as a gangster, it's not much acting. When you cast me as a cop, you get a cop with an interesting dynamic, so it works out better. But I like playing bad guys. I can't wait to play a villain again. They're one-dimensional, and they're fun. All you gotta do is make people hate you, and it's easy. Playing the hero is difficult, 'cause you want people to like you, but you don't want to be corny. I'm just happy to act. As far as acting, I'm not worried about being typecast. I'm just worried about being cast. I love acting, and that's the fun of acting -- trying to make the role interesting.

Final Level is the name of your film production company, gaming podcast, and Twitter handle. Why that moniker?

It's kind of an ode to video gaming. You're always trying to get to the final level. I feel the same about life -- there are levels, and you're always trying to ante up and move to the next level of understanding. It kinda matches what me and my crew are always trying to do, always trying to get to that next level. Although I'm not truly on the final level, it's where we're trying to go. People ask me what the final level is, and I always say that it's inner peace. When you finally get your head together and are at peace, I think that's the most difficult level to reach. That sounds like some Buddhist shit [laughs], but call it what you want.

What are your top mobile apps?

1. Twitter, because it's kind of like a website where you get to say shit and can keep people abreast of what you're doing.

2. I think everyone should have Coco's Workout World, which is really important to keep your booty in shape. I can't do any of the exercises on the app, but it's fun to watch Coco do her thing. It works out for working out or soft porn.

3. I do have Instagram, but I'm not a big fan of taking pictures of everything that fu*king moves. That's corny. But I'm forced into every once in a while putting pictures on Instagram.

4. I got one called FatBooth, and it allows you to take a picture of your friends and make them fat. I can make their faces fat, and it shows them what they'll look like if they gain 30 pounds. It's kinda fun.

5. I have a Podcasts app, because, of course, by having my own podcast, I had to figure out a way to listen to it, and YouTube requires a podcast app.

6. I don't have any goofy apps on here. No dumb shit. I use Dropbox, which is an app to help move big files around.

I guess I'm pretty boring when it comes to apps. I don't play video games on the phone. I don't like the phone. I turn it off. My wife always has her phone, and that's usually the better way to get to me. I wouldn't carry a phone around if I didn't have to. But I fu*king hate talking on the phone.",html
http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20051604-264.html,IE9: Microsoft is back in the browser game,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"After a three-week IE9 immersion, I've concluded that Microsoft once again has a competitive Web browser.

And even though Internet Explorer remains the most-used browser on the Net today, convincing me that Internet Explorer 9 is a real browser was quite an accomplishment. Here's why.

IE6, now a decade old, is loathed by Web developers the world over for its lack of standards support, and it's the focus of a Microsoft effort that's trying to get the companies and people using the browser to modernize. After a five-year hiatus, IE7 emerged with some handy features, such as tabbed browsing and a search box, but it was mostly about trying to catch up with rivals such as Firefox and Opera that hadn't idled away the years.

IE8 took the major step of trying to conform to Web standards, using a ""compatibility view"" mode only as a fallback to show sites that had been crafted for earlier versions of IE. But it still lagged other browsers in the breadth of standards it supported, and it crawls when executing the ever-more-important Web-based JavaScript programs.

Even though IE is built into Windows, the most widely used personal computer operating system on the planet, its share of usage steadily diminished as people realized there was a better answer. Microsoft had competed fiercely with Netscape in the 1990s and won, but then it sat back and left the innovation to others.

Thus, the world of Web developers and technical enthusiasts can be forgiven for being skeptical about IE9.

But as I see it, Microsoft has fully awoken here. No doubt the influence of Apple's Safari and Google's Chrome helped ring the alarm bells and shake loose funding for programmers and marketing, but Microsoft's grasp of the importance of the Web is much more than a knee-jerk reflex to catch up to rivals.

My life with IE9

The browser itself worked well for me, for the most part. My top pick is still Chrome, with Firefox 4 a close second, but IE9 got the job done.

After an initial week of kicking the tires, I took the plunge and set it as default browser. I spend most of my working day, and a lot of my off hours, in a browser, so that's actually a big step. Slow browsers drive me nuts.

I compiled a list of 38 complaints as I was testing IE9. That may sound like a lot, but many are petty ones such as occasionally blank full-screen YouTube videos or wonky page rendering on Picplz and Apple's online store. The proof that IE9 had passed the test was that after I had set it as default browser, I rarely cringed as I contemplated the prospect of clicking a link, the way I had with IE8.

My biggest problem using IE9 was that it chained me to a deskbound quad-core Dell Windows PC (it's a laptop, but five cables tether it down). I missed the lumbar-preserving stand-up arrangement I use for my other main machine, a MacBook Pro. In other words, it was an issue that had nothing to do with the browser itself.

screenshot by Stephen Shankland/CNET

I did have some complaints I think are worth mentioning. Chief among them:

 Tab management--I often have dozens open--was no better than with most browsers today, and often worse. The integration with the taskbar probably helps people who use mice to navigate a smaller number of tabs, but I use keyboard shortcuts (ctrl-tab), and a long list of text wasn't much better than a long list of tabs. I'm glad Microsoft added the option to add a new row of tabs below the combined search/address bar, but I wish there was a way to activate that option only when tabs in the ordinary configuration get too narrow. IE groups tabs by color, but I find this organizational scheme marginally useful sometimes and a hidrance at other times, so I shut it off. When I hold down ctrl-tab to zing past a large number of tabs, many intermediate tabs don't get highlighted in the tab strip, requiring me to guess how far I've gone and when to stop. Finally, IE9 often didn't pick up a site's favicon correctly, and I find those tiny graphics very useful for quickly locating the tab I want.

 Google Docs is hobbled. I spend a lot of time with Google's online word procesor and spreadsheet, and both suffered performance lags, despite the speed boost of IE9's Chakra engine for running JavaScript. The word processor was fine until documents got moderately long--one or two thousand words--then it started dragging. The spreadsheet seemed to have trouble even earlier. Perhaps Google bears some of the responsibility here, but Firefox, Safari, and Chrome don't suffer from this same drawback. I also had a temporary showstopper: when my display was zoomed to 125 percent and the Google Docs page was shrunk, the cursor would be misplaced. Changing the zoom settings back to 100 percent all around fixed it.

 IE9 just didn't have quite as light a feel as Chrome or Firefox. When there's that little bit of lag when you repeat the same action over and over--Ctrl-T to spawn a new tab or Ctrl-L to start typing a search term or Web address--it just wears you down. For all the vaunted hardware acceleration in IE9, its user interface response was just a bit poky.

 Is it the browser or the OS? Antitrust settlement notwithstanding, IE9 still feels enmeshed with Windows. This time the installation didn't require a reboot, an improvement over IE8 and over Safari upgrades on Mac OS X, but the trade-off is that for installation, you must first quit any application that gets within a mile of HTML rendering. For me that was Photoshop, Avast antivirus, Firefox, Chrome, Google Talk Plugin, HP Digital Imaging Monitor, Java SE binary, Java Update Scheduler, Skype, Synaptics Touchpad Enhancements, Tweetdeck, Windows Desktop Gadgets, Windows Explorer, Windows Host Process (Rundll32), Windows Live Mesh, Yahoo Messenger. To its credit, the installer restarted my antivirus software afterward. I also still dislike seeing ""Internet options"" and ""Windows Update"" in IE9 menus. These are operating system actions, but Microsoft probably is leery of removing them after so many people have learned to find them in IE.

But overall, IE9 was a capable, competent browser. Its gradual arrival will liberate Web developers hobbled by old browsers--especially as Windows 7 finally replaces Windows XP at corporations wedded to IE6.

W3C

The ever-expanding Web

Today's Web is a vastly more powerful platform for software than a decade ago. Graphical elements and formatting are richer and more dynamic with modern Cascading Style Sheets technology, and JavaScript has come into its own with higher performance in browsers and libraries such as jQuery that make it easier to use. HTML5's vaunted video tag and the coming WebSocket specification can make pages even more active, while storage technologies can let Web applications work even when there's no network connection.

It's a world where Google Docs can be a viable replacement for Microsoft Office for some fraction of the market, and where programmers can contemplate massively multiplayer online games built from Web standards.

With IE9, Microsoft has embraced this vision, even though it undermines two other important programming foundations from Microsoft, the company's Windows operating system and its Silverlight technology that serves both as a browser plug-in and as Windows Phone 7's native application technology.

That internal competition must have made for some heated meetings, but really, Microsoft had little choice. Powerful rivals were moving together down the Web-app path, and developers were following. It's a classic cannibalization story: sometimes a company is better off embracing a popular technology that hurts its own products, because the alternative is letting competitors inflict the pain.

Thus, at the same time it was building IE9, Microsoft re-engaged with Web standards work with HTML, CSS, Scalable Vector Graphics, typography, and more. Many of these standards are present in IE9, one indicator that Microsoft isn't faking its support for the new Web merely with marketing bafflegab.

Microsoft also embraced many healthy practices developing IE9. Publicly released platform preview editions let Web developers test the browser as it evolved, and Microsoft responded to feedback.

To be sure, IE9 still lacks support for a number of Web standards. But I'd rather see an IE9 in its present state and released than an IE9 supporting all those standards but arriving sometime at the end of 2011. I don't expect Microsoft to adopt Google's six-week update cycle, but I do think successors to IE9 are under active development, and I see no reason why animated (and hardware-accelerated) CSS transitions and transformations aren't on the to-do list.

WebGL--the hardware-accelerated 3D graphics interface all the other browser makers have embraced--is a big question mark for IE. Microsoft has a competing interface in Silverlight 5, which goes into beta testing this week, not to mention native Windows apps using DirectX. But judging by IE9, it's not unthinkable that Microsoft would support it somehow, if enough developers used it on the Web.

The new ""Do Not Track"" feature in Firefox 4 beta 11 for Windows, Mac, and Linux sends out a header that tells Web sites that you want to opt out of behavioral tracking, though Mozilla cautions in a blog post that it will take some time for sites and advertisers to respond to the header.

(Credit: Mozilla)

The feature can be toggled via a check box in the Advanced tab of Firefox's Options window.

Mozilla privacy lead Alex Fowler said that the engineers decided to base the feature in the header sent from the browser because it's something that all Web pages read as they load. A blacklist or cookie-based solution would be harder to implement across different browsers. He acknowledged that successful implementation of ""Do Not Track"" also depends on advertisers and site owners respecting that incoming header.

He added that the initial stages of a legislative fix are under way as at least one member of Congress--Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.)--plans to introduce a bill ordering the Federal Trade Commission to create a ""Do Not Track"" program for advertisers. However, a second bill also being proposed does not include the ""Do Not Track"" option. Both might have a hard time passing in today's antiprivacy climate, although a bill with ""Do Not Track"" would be the harder sell because of its stronger privacy controls.

Mozilla security and privacy engineer Sid Stamm has documented the technical implementation of ""Do Not Track.""

Other changes in Firefox 4 beta 11--which Mozilla hopes will be the penultimate Firefox 4 beta--include moving connection status messages to a small overlay window, re-enabling WebGL on Linux, disabling automatic switching to offline mode when no network connection is detected, and a redesign of the default about:home page.

Since I'm an amateur photography nerd with aspirations of rock stardom, I'm most interested in iPhoto and GarageBand, though the new iMovie may be enough for me to whip out my Flip camcorder and record more than just dogs riding on skateboards. Of course, iWeb '09 has a few updates, too. I have just got through the iPhoto '09 face recognition hurdle, and am just starting on the rest of the iLife suite. So here's an in-depth look at the facial recognition bit of iPhoto, with more to come later.

iPhoto '09

Lets start with the belle of the ball, iPhoto '09. Why do I say that? Because the new Faces and Places feature on iPhoto '09 was definitely one of the biggest news out of Phil Schiller's Macworld keynote. While iPhoto '08 introduced Events, which lets you group photos based on the dates they were taken, iPhoto '09 introduced three new features that got the Mac community buzzing--facial recognition, geotagging, and social network support. For the facial recognition, you don't have to tag every single photo you have with a name and a face; the idea is that iPhoto '09 will be smart enough to do the facial recognition for you. However, it will only work after you do the necessary legwork to make it all happen.

Assuming you don't have photos in your iPhoto library already, you'll have to import them. Me, I have about 3,500 photos sitting in my Aperture library on the laptop, and that's not even counting the more than 10,000 photos I have in my external hard drive at home. So if you're a big photography dork like me, it'll take some time for all the photos to import over. Once that happens, you can immediately start identifying faces and names. Sometimes iPhoto will be smart enough to detect faces for you, and sometimes it won't be. If it does detect a face, it'll display a square over what it thinks is a face, with a placeholder name ""unknown face"" underneath it. If it doesn't detect a face, you'll have to hit the ""Add Missing Face"" button on the bottom left, select the face, and add a name. Once you identify a face with a name, you can go to the Faces corkboard, select a face, and iPhoto '09 will scout out your entire library to find photos with a similar face. Once it does, it's up to you to go through the results to confirm or not confirm if the photos really do show that person. This is how the facial recognition training works.

Nicole Lee/CBS Interactive

In my brief 30 minutes or so futzing around with the application, the facial recognition is impressive, but it's by no means perfect. The biggest hurdle seems to be with simply detecting faces in the first place. Not every photo of a person is necessarily a perfect head-on style portrait, especially if you take a lot of candid shots of people looking away from the camera, resulting in a less-than-ideal profile. What's weirder is that iPhoto often sees faces that aren't even there--any combination of shapes or shadows that sort of resemble a face gets picked up mistakenly. In the beginning, it can get a little tiresome selecting and confirming faces.

Nicole Lee/CBS Interactive

As for the actual face recognition itself, this will only get better the more samples you have. I tried this out on my own photos, and at first almost every single person who wears glasses was mistaken as yours truly. Alternately, almost everyone who had a beard was identified as the same person. As I started to really go through my photos, confirming and not confirming them, did the results get better. It's not ideal, but the facial recognition goes a long way in making photo organization that much easier, so I'm mostly happy with it.

The next big feature add-on in iPhoto '09 is Places, which lets you geotag your photos. I haven't played around with this too much yet, but I can give you a few brief details about it. The Places feature is especially useful if you have a GPS-enabled camera or camera phone, since iPhoto '09 will detect the longitude and latitude of photos taken with those devices immediately. Bear in mind though, that if you took the photos at a place where you can't get GPS signal, the location won't register. But even if you don't have a GPS camera, you can enter in the location manually by going to the Info page on each photo (you go there by selecting the ""i"" icon on the bottom right of each photo). Now you can see where your photos are on a map.

The third big update in iPhoto '09 is that you can upload the photos to Facebook, Flickr, or MobileMe. If you add Facebook IDs to the faces in the photos, iPhoto can then match them with your list of Facebook friends. Similarly, the geotag information in your photos is transferred over when you upload your photos to Flickr. Last, but not least, iPhoto '09 comes with a few image enhancement tools such as red-eye reduction, smart saturation, definition improvement, and more. The slide show tool is also improved, as there's an option to use the face detection to do the Ken Burns pan and zoom effect. When you're all done, you can load the slide show to your iPod or iPhone for portable viewing.

I'll need the whole weekend to get going on the rest of iLife '09 here, but here's a taste of what's coming: iMovie '09 sees more advanced features but there's still no timeline, music lessons make GarageBand '09 completely worth the money, and iWeb '09 still can't win me over despite its newfangled widgets.",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20012433-12.html,"Trillian 5 beta for Windows is now here, looking good","August,Pm,Jessica Dolcourt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"We caught wind of a refresh to the Cerulean Studios' Trillian all-in-one IM app a month ago, and starting Monday, the refurbished Trillian 5 beta for Windows is open to all.

As promised, Trillian 5 beta (download) now integrates with LinkedIn and Foursquare social networking services (access this from the handy accounts ribbon on the buddy list), and it improves the behavior of Facebook and Twitter feeds. Foursquare users on Windows 7 computers will be able to check-in from Trillian 5 beta thanks to Windows 7's GPS support. In addition to reading feeds, you're able to set your status as well.

Using the social feeds wasn't as intuitive as we would have liked. You have to hover the cursor over the account listing and select the ""pin"" option from the context menu to get your feed to appear in the buddy list. You'll need to choose ""share a message"" to update your status.

We like being able to reorder the icons around the account ribbon on the top of the buddy list.

Trillian 5 sports a completely refashioned interface, from the buddy list to the chat windows, though some changes are subtle. You're now able to optionally disable toolbars to keep Trillian even lighter and leaner, and differentially resize separate areas of the buddy list. A ""simple"" view strips away avatars and friends' status updates to give you a condensed view of the buddy list. There's also a no-skin option for Windows Vista and Windows 7 users who choose the native glass border instead of either of the two of Trillian 5's skinning options (we vastly prefer Cobalt over Cordonata on Windows XP).

Though Trillian still took a fair amount of time to install, exiting and restarting the instant messaging client felt faster than previous builds, as promised. The company has also made efforts to streamline its registration process.

There is one more beta feature we'll all have to be patient to try out. Synchronizing chat history through your account so you can view it on any Trillian installation is one of the more-major features we anticipated. That one will appear in a subsequent beta build, along with a black theme, we're told.



Though we're saving our full judgment for the final release, we will say that this iteration is looking pretty good so far, minus a few usability quirks.

Little has been known about stealth start-up RockMelt except that it's a browser, specifically (and yet ambiguously) a ""Facebook browser,"" and it's backed by browser godfather Marc Andreessen. Well, now RockMelt has crept out of the woodwork into a limited beta for Mac and Windows, and the world can get a peek at it.

RockMelt is indeed a ""Facebook browser,"" if only because Facebook is the social-media service that's best integrated into it at launch. It's clear that ultimately the browser's team plans to make it more customizable with other services. The ultimate goal, you could say, is revamping the traditional browser many of the Web-browsing behaviors that have popped up in the past few years--social-media sharing, Twitter clients, RSS alerts, and speedier search--and works them into an interface that aims for convenience rather than confusion. While it may still have too many bells and whistles for the average Web user, it's likely to attract some curiosity from hardcore social-media users, obsessive multitaskers, and efficiency geeks who see an opportunity to cut down on the number of browser tabs and desktop applications that they may have open.

""We're reinventing the browser for how people user the Web today, which is dramatically different from how people were using the Web only a few short years ago,"" RockMelt co-founder Tim Howes told CNET.

First of all, you log in with Facebook Connect upon launching RockMelt. There's a left sidebar of easy Facebook access, including a row of ""top friends"" that you can select, and you can drag or drop content from the main browser (like links or videos) to immediately share it with one of them in Facebook Chat. (Unfortunately, there is not yet support for other instant-messaging clients.)

Then, on the right side bar, is a customizable list of favorite sites and services, with yellow indicators to tell you when there's new content from a blog you read or the people you follow on Twitter. There's a browser button to share content on Facebook or Twitter (and more services to come); the company even has its own URL shortener, http://me.lt.

The search box at the top is also different than your average browser's. It loads up a list of results in a drop-down menu, and begins ""preloading"" all of them so that you can flip back and forth between individual results at maximum speed.

""It changes the way you search because it makes it so much faster and so much lighter-weight,"" co-founder Eric Vishria explained.

The term ""social browser"" has been thrown about before, namely three years ago with the launch of Flock, a Firefox-based browser loaded with a dizzying number of social features. RockMelt certainly looks a lot cleaner. Built on Chromium, the foundation of Google Chrome, it aims to be fast, too.

Will people actually switch over to it? Vishria raised a statistic that in the past three years, 500 million people have switched browsers, so that getting them to switch again may be less difficult than it sounds.

RockMelt employs about 30 people, has been in the works for two years, and has raised about $10 million in funding from the Andreessen Horowitz venture firm as well as other investors like Josh Kopelman of First Round Capital and ubiquitous angel investor Ron Conway.

And its odd, vaguely geology-evoking name? It ""came out of a three-week brainstorming sesion where we had a million different names,"" Howes said. Added Vishria: ""Easy to spell, easy to remember, and the domain was available.""",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20045726-12.html,"Firefox 4 launches into a tougher, faster world","March,Am,Seth Rosenblatt",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Three years ago, Firefox 3 set the record for most downloads in a 24-hour period, cracking 8 million and positioning itself as a viable alternative to Internet Explorer.

Firefox 4 released today to the public at large after 12 public betas, two release candidates, and nearly a year of development, faces a hugely different landscape. (Download Firefox 4 here for Windows, Mac, and Linux.) Microsoft's Internet Explorer remains the dominant browser. And in less than three years, a significant chunk of the browser market has taken a shine to relative newcomer Google Chrome.

Mozilla flips the switch from version 3.6.15 to version 4 as Firefox possesses more than 400 million active users. (Mozilla has opened a download tracker at glow.mozilla.org.) The new version of the browser sports several massive changes, including a radically redesigned interface, significantly faster browsing speeds, strong support for the still-in-development HTML5 and other ""future-Web"" tech, and competitive features like synchronization, restart-less add-ons, and tab grouping. You can read the official CNET reviews of Firefox 4 at the Download.com pages for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Browser speed remains an important point of comparison. But as the five major browsers have developed over the past year, their speed differences have become more muddled. For example, Mozilla noted that when Firefox 3 was released, it took ""60 milliseconds to change Gmail from showing one message to another with Firefox 3... compared with 413 milliseconds for IE 7 and 227 for Firefox 2.""

Current browser benchmarks that look only at JavaScript place them all in the same ballpark now, so the point of comparison has begun to shift to graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware acceleration. This allows the browser to shove certain rendering tasks onto the computer's graphics card, freeing up CPU resources while making page rendering and animations load faster. These tasks include composition support, rendering support, and desktop compositing, and there are few benchmarks that are capable of testing it.

One interesting publicly available benchmark is the new JSGameBench from Facebook, which looks to test HTML5 in real-world gaming situations. The Firefox 4 beta was the fastest tested without WebGL and was the second fastest with it. Mozilla's own tests put Firefox 4 at three to six times faster than Firefox 3.6.

Mozilla remains a leader in developing the Web, and interestingly that role has led it to hold back on building out one of the more interesting minor features in Firefox 4. The new do-not-track feature supports a header on Web sites that tells sites and advertisers not to track you, so you don't see targeted ads as often. Internet Explorer also supports the header, and it includes robust, configurable support for blocking ad trackers; Firefox 4 relies on add-ons like AdBlock Plus to gain the list blocking.

Johnathan Nightingale, director of Firefox development at Mozilla, explained during a conversation last week at CNET's San Francisco office that Mozilla is more concerned with the larger problem of why ads were targeted in the first place.

""Beyond blocking the ad loads, which you can do with add-ons, this is a business-social trust situation between sites and users. We need people to vote with their feet, or at least want to have that conversation. We've spoken to a lot of advertisers. And by and large, they want to be good citizens here,"" Nightingale said. As a current solution, though, that makes users entirely dependent on advertiser behavior, which is likely to fall short of what people want.

Another security repair in Firefox 4 fixes a hole that affected all browsers until last summer--a vulnerability so old that it was mentioned in the documentation for CSS2 a decade ago. The exploit is a CSS sniffing history attack, in which malicious code can gain access to your browser history by manipulating link appearance and style. What made the bug so difficult to repair is that the simplest solution--to prevent all link style manipulation--would be like throwing the baby out with the bathwater, Nightingale had said in an interview at Black Hat 2010.

Nightingale also addressed other changes in Firefox 4 as providing the feature in question without playing fast and loose with a user's data. Firefox 4 removes the ""lucky"" automatic search results from the location bar's search functionality because Mozilla had ""concerns about sending a lot of private data from the location bar to search engines. We will get there,"" he added, ""but like with Sync we want to do it right.""

Sync is another new feature in Firefox 4 and is possibly one of the best implementations of the feature across the competition. Not only can you synchronize your data across traditional PC versions of Firefox, but you also can sync your bookmarks, passwords, preferences, history, and tabs with your Android or Maemo-running phone or tablet. However, Sync debuted in 2008 as an add-on and had a notably rough beginning. Fortunately for user data, which it used to delete seemingly at will, Mozilla fixed the problems with it.

Along with the Android support, Sync gets two security features right. One is that Firefox encrypts your data before sending it over an encrypted connection to its servers, where it remains encrypted. Mozilla said it could not access the data even if somebody there wanted to. The second is that you have the option of setting up your own personal sync server. In an age in which private data stored by corporations gets hacked and stolen with shocking regularity, setting up a personal sync server is one way to ensure that you bear the responsibility for your own data. The only problem with the feature is that it doesn't yet support syncing add-ons, a factor that is at least partially tied to Firefox's nascent restart-less add-on network, also debuting in version 4.

Other big changes in Firefox 4 include a minimalist interface with a condensed menu button that closely resembles that of Opera 11 and Chrome 10; app tabs; tab groups for keeping tabs organized; an overhauled add-on manager that also supports restart-less add-ons; and expansive support for HTML5, CSS3, and the aforementioned hardware acceleration for Direct2D and Direct3D on Windows, OpenGL on Mac, and XRender on Linux.

One ""future-Web"" tech that Nightingale said probably won't come to Firefox before version 5 is support for WebSocket. ""The specification had security problems, so we turned it off,"" he said. He added that users can enable it at will through the ""websocket"" options in about:config.

Although it took more than two and a half years for Firefox 4 to get here, expect that time to get axed like a tree in a rainforest for Firefox 5. Mozilla plans to put Firefox on an accelerated release schedule, much like Google has done with Chrome.

CNET

Along with introducing the new iPhone 4S , Apple gave a brief look at iOS 5 at Apple's ""Let's Talk iPhone"" event (full event and iPhone 4S coverage here) this morning in Cupertino, Calif. Tim Cook opened the event, but he turned to Scott Forstall, Apple's senior vice president of iPhone software, to show off highlights of a promised 200 new features in iOS 5. Available for free, iOS 5 will be compatible with the iPhone 4S, the iPhone 4 , the iPhone 3GS , both versions of the iPad, and the third- and fourth-generation models of the iPod Touch.

In today's event, we saw a recap of features originally debuted at WWDC including the new notification system, Twitter integration, and Reminders, but also some new features added to the list with Find My Friends, Cards, and Siri, a voice-controlled assistant that will only be available to iPhone 4S users. iOS 5 will officially become available over the air for free starting on October 12.

Find My Friends

Among the new features announced only today, Find My Friends lets you view your friends' and family's locations in real time on a map when they agree to share location info with you. You'll be able to set a time limit as well, letting people only view your location for a period you specify--a major concern of people who don't want to continually broadcast their location.

Cards

Cards, a new greeting card delivery app, also got some screen time. Cards lets you design a card on your iOS device and have Apple print it up on high-quality paper and send it to your chosen recipient. The service comes with a price, though; you'll pay $2.99 to send a card domestically and $4.99 to send a card anywhere in the world.

Notifications

Instead of the current system of pop-up menus that interrupt your work, a new Notification Center will combine messages, missed calls, app updates, a stock ticker, and the current weather in a single place. You can access it by swiping your finger downward from the top of the screen (sound familiar?) and notifications will appear on the lock screen as well. You then can jump directly to the related feature for each notification and delete items by tapping the small X next to each line.

Though not exactly original--the pull-down menu has long been a hallmark feature of Android--the ability to see all notifications in one place is nonetheless welcome. Since the first iPhone's debut four years ago, the iOS notification system has remained largely unchanged. It's simple, yes, but the current application is unusable until you dismiss the message, and several messages in a row quickly became annoying. So it's about time we got this change.

Newsstand

This app will bring together magazine subscriptions in a central place. The concept is similar to iBooks, even down to an icon that looks like the periodicals shelf at your local library. As you subscribe to a publication through a new channel in the App Store, new issues will be delivered in the background, eliminating the need to manually grab them when they publish.

Twitter

Thankfully, users now will be able to post photos to the social networking service without leaving the image gallery or camera application. It's a nice change given that it will end the need to take a photo, switch to the iPhone Twitter app, and then post the photo. You'll be able to add a location, sync Twitter with your contacts list, and tweet directly from YouTube, Safari, and Maps.

Safari

The mobile version of Apple's Web browser will get the Reader option that was announced at the 2010 WWDC . As you'd expect, it will streamline multipage articles in an RSS-like view while stripping out ads, but leaving photos. You'll also be able to e-mail the entire text of a Safari page to a contact (presently, you can send only a link).

In other Safari news, tabbed browsing will come to the iPad at last and you can bookmark a Web page on a Reading List list for future perusal. The latter feature can be synced between multiple Safari devices and should work very similarly to browser add-ons like Read It Later and Instapaper.

Reminders

This handy addition will let you store multiple to-do lists with dates for each event and categorize reminders by location. So, for example, if you have a reminder of ""Call home when I leave work,"" the app will use GPS to note when you're on the move and send the reminder. Reminders can be shared between devices and sync with iCal on the Mac with CalDAV, and on Windows with MS Exchange.

Camera

iOS 5 will add a shortcut on the lock screen that will launch the camera immediately, even bypassing the lock code. You then can use the volume control to snap the photo. Inside the camera you'll get grid lines, pinch to zoom (instead of using the slider bar at the bottom of the screen), autofocus, and the ability to change the exposure and add granular controls.

After taking photos, you can edit your shots with crop, rotate, and red-eye reduction. Also, one-click enhancements from iPhoto will add quick color correction. Though we welcome these additions, Apple is late to the photo-editing party as this functionality has long existed on basic phones. We'll have to see how Apple makes it all work when iOS 5 is available, but we doubt it will mean the demise of third-party apps like Photoshop Express.

Mail

Coming to the mail app are rich text formatting, better indent control, flagging of messages, and the ability to drag addresses between to, cc, and bcc lines. Also, you now can search within the body of a message instead of just in the from, to, and subject lines. Thanks for that.

PC Free

Arguably the most notable change, PC Free will bring over-the-air software updates and device activations. So as on Android, Windows Phone 7, and BlackBerry OS 5 devices, you'll no longer have to plug your device into a computer or even own a computer at all. The updates will serve only the changes, so they'll be shorter, and you'll be able to sync, back up, and restore your device using the new iCloud feature. You'll also find new features within apps, like wirelessly editing photos, managing e-mail folders, and creating and deleting calenders.

Game Center

Additions for gamers include profile photos, achievement point comparison, friends of friends, recommended friends and games, support for turn-based games, and a way to buy games directly from Game Center.

iMessage

Apple takes a shot at BlackBerry with this instant messaging app that will work across all iOS 5 devices. As with BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), you'll be able to exchange unlimited text messages, photos, and videos with your friends, family, and colleagues. Also, your messages won't cost you anything and they won't count against the monthly allotment of messages from your wireless carrier.

You'll also get group messaging, an indicator to see if someone is typing to you, delivery and read receipts, secure encryption, and conversation syncing that is pushed to multiple devices. iMessage will work on 3G and Wi-Fi networks.

What else

Other updates include new multitasking gestures for the iPad, hourly weather forecasts, Wi-Fi sync with iTunes, a split keyboard for the iPad, a new iPad music app, an iTunes ringtone store, AirPlay mirroring for the iPad 2 , a personal dictionary, alternate routes in Maps, Emoji emoticons, and custom vibration patterns.

Siri

A feature exclusive to the iPhone 4S, Siri builds on the iOS Voice Control feature while adding a lot more. Presented as an AI voice control system that comprehends what you're saying, Siri lets you give your iPhone commands or ask it questions using natural language. It's more than just a ""Call home"" voice command system; you can simply say, ""Remind me to call my wife at 4:30 about dinner"" and Siri will respond by setting up a time in your calendar and repeating the specifics of the event so you can confirm it for a reminder. You can also tell Siri to read your latest text messages, and you can ask it the fastest way home from your current location and other complex questions, and Apple says Siri will comprehend your questions and give you the best answer. These are features that anyone can appreciate who's been driving and heard the iPhone's telltale text notification sound, for example. It also ushers in a new way to interface with iPhones, if Apple can pull it off. Siri is still in beta and will be available to iPhone 4S users at launch on October 14. For more on Siri, see our iPhone 4S First Take .

A big deal or no?

Compared with previous updates, iOS 5 is rather low-key. Sure, it adds some welcome features that will benefit users--we especially like PC Free and the new notifications--but it's not quite the whopper update that iOS 4 or even iOS 3 was.

What's more, even the most die-hard Apple fans will have to admit that some of the new features simply bring the iPhone in line with options we currently see on other smartphone operating systems or in third-party apps. On the other hand, Apple has always excelled at taking existing features and creating a different user experience, and that may be the case here.

Indeed, we'll have to use iOS 5 before we give a real assessment of its features. There may be more spectacular changes that Apple hasn't announced, but we don't see iOS 5 alone as a reason to switch to the iPhone if you haven't done so already. But when you couple it with the upgrades in the iPhone 4S, it may be enough.",html

Apple Pay has become the most popular payment option of its kind, Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the company's earnings call Tuesday.

The service continues to add financial institutions to its roster -- it's now up to 750 banks and credit unions -- and makes up more than $2 out of every $3 spent on purchases using contactless payments, according to Cook. (Contactless payments cover any devices -- smart-cards included -- that make payments using a radio frequency.) Cook also highlighted Apple Pay's rollout to over 200,000 payment kiosks, including parking meters, laundry machines and vending machines, through a partnership with USA Technologies announced earlier in the day.

""We are more confident than ever that 2015 will be the year of Apple Pay,"" he said.

The service went live in October with about 500 financial-institution partners and 220,000 merchants.

Apple unveiled Apple Pay at the launch of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in September, and like its competitors, it wants to establish a digital replacement for the wallet. The similarly intended Google Wallet also lets consumers tap and pay for items in a store, while wireless carriers have joined together to support a service called Softcard.

But even though people have been able to purchase digital goods, like ringtones, through text messages for years, nothing has been able to convince shoppers to ditch their traditional wallets.

Apple thinks Apple Pay could be the catalyst for consumers. The service works by allowing users to simply tap an iPhone to a payment terminal and then touch their phone's fingerprint sensor to authorize a purchase. Both the devices and the terminals must have near-field communication (NFC) chips that store payment credentials -- something that limits the service to the new iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. The service will also work with Apple's highly anticipated smartwatch. Cook mentioned during Tuesday's call that the watch would start shipping in April.

Apple Pay had opposition from a large group of merchants early on. Some members of the Merchant Customer Exchange, or MCX -- a consortium of retailers led by Walmart -- decided to disable consumers' ability to use Apple Pay , in anticipation of the launch of MCX's alternative payments service. Cook dismissed the event as ""a skirmish.""

So far, the scuffle hasn't slowed down enthusiasm for Apple Pay, according to Cook's anecdotes. He highlighted two key merchants during the call. The Panera Bread restaurant chain, one of Apple's earliest partners for the mobile payments service, said Apple Pay transactions make up 80 percent of the chain's mobile transactions. For grocer Whole Foods, another partner, mobile transactions have gone up by 400 percent since Apple Pay became available three months ago.

The latest rough version of the browser improves secure HTTP support in several ways, updates the V8 JavaScript engine to version 3.4.3.0, and tightens security when installing Web apps from the Chrome Web Store.

The security changes are small but nevertheless could have a positive effect on your browser's security. Chrome 14 dev supports DNSSEC authentication for HTTPS, which strengthens the secure Web protocol, and Chrome 14 dev for Macs fixes invalid server certificate errors that were being generated for some secure sites that had untrusted roots certificate authorities. The Chrome Web Store now prompts with a native confirmation dialog box when installing a Web app, which streamlines how the Web store appears to integrate with your computer. SSL v3 server connectivity issues have been fixed, which will prevent some connections from being lost.

Google is taking HTTPS issues quite seriously and has taken steps to address mixed secure site scripting conditions in Chrome 14 dev. Just after announcing that Gmail will always load in HTTPS, the company has ensured that mixed secure site scripting conditions are blocked by default in Chrome 14 dev. The first is a command line flag that actually landed in Chrome 13 dev called --no-running-insecure-content for advanced users who want to help clean up sites with mixed secure scripts. Another flag is available that will block the display of insecure content, --no-displaying-insecure-content, but Google stated in the above-linked blog post that it will not block displaying insecure content by default since it's not as dangerous a use-case.

And in a hat-tip to the users and site administrators who may not have the resources to address the issue immediately, Google has included an inverse flag: --allow-running-insecure-content.

Also, Linux users get a makeshift multiple profile support button for creating different browsing profiles from within the browser.

There are some known bugs with Chrome 14 dev, including nonfunctioning keyboard volume controls within the browser and a browser crash related to reloading a site via HTTP Post, which most often appears as the confirmation page following a form submission from an online transaction.

Along with bumping Chrome dev to version 14, Google has moved its beta channel to Chrome 13. Chrome 13 beta (download for Windows | Mac | Linux) makes two notable changes to the browser. The first is the addition of pre-rendering technology that will make some Google search results appear ""almost instantly,"" according to Google's Chrome blog. Since pre-rendering is a Web standard, it's not limited to Google and can be used by other Web developers. The second is a fix for a bug that's been annoying Chrome users since 2008: the lack of a print preview. Still no word on default support for RSS feeds, which requires users to install an add-on before it will work in Chrome.

The release notes for Chrome 14 dev are available here. Google's official notes on Chrome 13 beta can be read here.",html

(Credit: TorrentFreak)

Available from the Swedish torrent Web site The Pirate Bay, the Cocoa-based client has been expected since 2006 when BitTorrent bought uTorrent and promised to develop a Mac version. There was little said since then, until this past August when uTorrent developer Greg Hazel announced that a Mac version would be ready ''in a few weeks,'' according to the torrent news Web site TorrentFreak.

Simon Morris, BitTorrent's vice president of product evelopment, responded to the leak by saying that the version currently in the wild was not supposed to get out and is not recommended for use, although he hopes that people now believe him when he says that there is a Mac uTorrent client in the works. There is an official notification list for eager users available at the uTorrent site. http://mac.utorrent.com/

Certain key features don't work yet, such as searching. Comments about the app on The Pirate Bay confirm its bugginess. So far it only seems to work on Intel-based Macs, and only those running OS X 10.5 or higher. Because this is an extremely early build of the client, it's not clear at this point how it will stand up to established Mac torrent clients such as Transmission, how it compares to its Windows sibling, or even if this means that a BitTorrent-branded Mac client is in the works.

Ironically, you'll need a torrent client to download this torrent client, since it's only available from a torrent Web site.

In addition to expanding its security offerings for the PC, the company plans to move at least some of its threat definitions to the cloud, while introducing a personal VPN and debuting an Android app with some features only for rooted phones.

(Credit: Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Avast Chief Technical Officer Ondrej Vlcek spoke to CNET during a recent tour of the company's virus lab about what the company had planned. Vlcek, who has been with Avast for 16 years and wrote the company's first Windows product, said that Avast looks to leverage its community data to develop better software for businesses as well as attract even more home consumers. ""In the next few months, we'll be coming out with some extra products not included in the suite, such as online backup, password management, and identity protection,"" Vlcek said.

Given Android's skyrocketing marketshare, it's not surprising that Avast is working on an Android security app, too. What's interesting is that Avast is aiming specifically for users who have rooted their phones. ""Rooted phones are more prone to certain kinds of attacks,"" said Vlcek, ""because they are more able to run a wider range of programs. We consider people with rooted phones higher-risk users, and so they need more security. Fifteen [percent] to 20 percent of Android phones are rooted, including the Nexus which comes rooted.""

He wouldn't reveal what the root-specific features Avast is considering are, but he did mention the app's basics. These included the company's antivirus engine, anti-theft and phone tracking, a contacts filter, and parental locks. A backup feature has yet to be settled on, he said, ""because there's a big difference between a contacts list backup and backing up media files and apps."" The company is also considering tying its WebRep engine for search result ratings and verification to the Android app. Vlcek wouldn't commit to a specific month for release, either, only saying that it would arrive sometime in the fourth quarter and be completely free.

The most unusual feature that Avast will soon offer, however, is a personal VPN for both desktops and mobile. ""It's a bit risky for us because we don't know how heavily people will be using it,"" Vlcek said. ""But because of the insecurity of open, public Wi-Fi, where somebody can copy your session cookie and log on, we had to make people safer."" The VPN solution will create a secure tunnel through which people can send data without fear of being tracked by an ISP or government, or having their computer or phone hacked.

""The Digital Millennium Act mandates ISPs to keep logs of everything for some time, and some people are not comfortable with that. We encrypt everything that goes through the ISP and then it's unencrypted after it passes through,"" he said. The VPN will support multiple secure protocols, including PPPT, OpenVPN, SSL, and L2TP. A new companion VPN client for desktops and smartphones will help users configure the VPN, Vlcek said, and there won't be any bandwidth limitations.

He also noted, with a smile, that it will also allow country IP address spoofing to one of 17 countries in North America, Europe, or Asia. Vlcek wasn't concerned about how useful it would be to people living in countries with restrictive Internet policies. ""The Chinese officials won't try to block it because they know that business people need it for travel,"" he said.

He wouldn't make the timeline for release of the VPN public, but Vlcek did say that it would be a paid product ""with yearly and monthly plans, in the ballpark of $50 year."" Avast Chief Executive Officer Vince Steckler said the company plans to start with the long-duration subscriptions but wants to move into micropayments so people can use the VPN on a per-session basis.

(Credit: Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)

Vlcek went on to talk about what's coming in the 2012 Avast suite, due next February. Avast will be moving at least some of its threat definitions to the cloud, following many of its competitors such as Symantec, Trend Micro, Microsoft, and Panda. Vlcek said that Avast's cloud-based detection will be better because of the number of active Avast users, which is more than 130 million people. ""With our user base, we have the potential to have a much stronger cloud than anybody else.""

Additionally, Avast is looking at running your browser in its auto-sandbox by default. ""Since just after the release of version 5, we haven't seen anything bypass the sandbox,"" Vlcek said.

Speaking of older versions of Avast, Vlcek also revealed some interesting numbers about which versions of the program people are using. It turns out, Internet Explorer and Firefox aren't the only programs struggling with version creep. About 60 percent of the active user base is on version 6, the current version, he said, but there are still about 15 percent of active users on version 4. ""These are mainly people running a cracked, pirated license. We actually converted about 1 million users to version 6 free by circulating a 'license key' and passively upgrading them,"" Vlcek said.

Avast has plans to compete with more feature-heavy paid security suites, too. Users will soon be able to get online backup and password management solutions from Avast. The company has licensed Mozy to provide an Avast-branded online backup option, said Vlcek, with ""no real changes"" to Mozy's license or fees.

Roboform will provide Avast's password management tool, for about $10 a year. ""We didn't use LastPass because they weren't very flexible about third parties,"" said Vlcek. ""The goal is to provide a low-cost password manager that we think our free users will enjoy.""

Vlcek said both the password manager and the online backup solutions will be available around before the end of the summer.",html
http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/windows-10-arrives-on-july-29,Windows 10 arrives on July 29,"June,Pm,Tom Mcnamara",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"After revealing Windows 10 eight months ago, Microsoft has finally announced a release date for the free upgrade from Windows 7 and 8.1: July 29, just eight weeks from now. This is a little earlier than expected, and there are a few strings attached. First, this date is for the upgrade only. Microsoft has not announced availability of the retail version of Windows 10 or of a standalone download. So, if you prefer to start fresh with a clean installation of Windows, or if you want to download the update once to install on multiple devices, or if you want to obtain it on release day and install it later, you will have to wait a little longer. Second, the version for cell phones, dubbed Windows 10 Mobile, is not a part of this scheme; its release date has not been announced.

The process works like this: Starting today, a Windows icon will pop up in your system tray if you are eligible for the upgrade. This icon comes courtesy of system update KB3035583, which installs an app called Get Windows 10. If you click the icon, the app window will open, and you can make a reservation for your download of Windows 10. Presumably this process enables Microsoft to gauge how many download servers it will need to handle the launch. You can also request an email confirmation, and you can cancel your reservation at any time. If you don't make a reservation now, you can still schedule a download of Windows 10 later on (though the offer of a free upgrade expires after one year).

Microsoft estimates that it will take anywhere from 20 minutes to over an hour to process the Windows 10 upgrade. The time to actually download it will depend on your connection speed and how much infrastructure Microsoft has put in place to handle the launch. Microsoft says that making a reservation will also allow it to transmit some installation files ahead of time, in the background. This is designed to ease the burden on its servers on release day, and to reduce installation time for you. The total download size for the upgrade to Windows 10 will be around 3GB.

Microsoft says that if your PC can run Windows 7 or 8.1, it should be able to run Windows 10. This update won't be like the jump from XP to Vista. The Get Windows 10 app that handles the upgrade process will also confirm that your PC is compatible. You can try Windows 10 in a virtual machine right now -- consult our handy guide and decide if you want to take the plunge.

People who are currently using the Windows 10 Insider Preview will need Windows 7 or 8.1 on their PC to get this free upgrade. Otherwise, Microsoft will probably shut off access at some point, as it did with the preview version of Windows 7. And if Microsoft detects that your version of 7 or 8.1 has been pirated, it will not schedule a download of the Windows 10 upgrade for you.

First announced on September 30, 2014, Windows 10 will introduce a number of major changes, including:",html

After much speculation that Flipboard was finally making its way to Android, app geeks were disappointed today, as the highly anticipated news reader did not debut at Samsung Mobile's London press event.

Rumblings in the industry suggested that Samsung Mobile would make the big announcement shortly after showing off its forthcoming Samsung Galaxy S III device, but those rumblings proved false as the show closed with nary a peep about preloaded app partners.

However, our colleagues at CNET UK and CNET Asia did get a glimpse of Flipboard for Android preinstalled on their S III demo units, so it certainly looks like its release is imminent. We haven't yet received official confirmation that it will, in fact, ship with Samsung's flagship Android device this summer.

As reported by Engadget, Flipboard reps say the Android app will be available for ""select phones in the coming months.""

http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20078435-264/facebook-blocks-a-second-contact-export-tool/,Facebook blocks a second contact export tool,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Open-Xchange's tool for helping people reconstruct their Facebook contact list on Google+ has fallen victim to Facebook's revocation of its privileges.

Open-Xchange, a maker of open-source e-mail and collaboration software, last week launched a tool that used the company's Social OX technology to help people assemble a list of their friends. It used connections to a combination of services such as LinkedIn and e-mail accounts to create a single ""magic address book.""

The tool didn't actually copy e-mail addresses from Facebook--only first and last names. It then matched those names to other e-mail records in the user's accounts. But Facebook disabled the API (application programming interface) key that the software used to read the names, Open-Xchange Chief Executive Rafael Laguna said.

Facebook gave two reasons for the move and underscored the seriousness of its decision with a warning about the repercussions:

1. You cannot use a user's friend list outside of your application, even if a user consents to such use, but you can use connections between users who have both connected to your application. (FPP II.11) 2. A user's friends' data can only be used in the context of the user's experience on your application. (FPP II.4) Please note that we will not re-enable violating applications and any policy issues in your existing and future apps will result in further enforcement actions.

Facebook told CNET its actions are an aspect of protecting Facebook users. ""The people who use Facebook expect us to protect the information they share with us, and prevent phishing, malware and scraping whenever possible. We are always reviewing and revising our user protections, and when we come across Platform integrations which violate our terms, we respond quickly,"" the company said in a statement.

Laguna objected to Facebook's decision. In a letter to the company, he said:

We are not aware of violating anything. We are using your API to extract the last name and first name fields. We are not parsing or scraping the e-mail address. That same data is available at your site under ""Account->Account Settings->Download Your Information"" in the resulting friends.html file.

This isn't the first time Facebook has made such a move. Facebook also blocked use of a Chrome extension by programmer Mohamed Mansour that would export not only names but also e-mail addresses, phone numbers, birthdays, and more. Mansour's tool didn't use Facebook's API for programmatic access, but instead extracted the data from the pages themselves.

The matter of who owns address-book data in Facebook was a hot one last year, when Google and Facebook got into a spat about contact-data sharing. But now that Google finally has what appears to be a viable competitor to Facebok, the issue is a really hot one.

Google probably only has something like a hundredth of Facebook's population. But with one Google+ user base estimate exceeding 4 million people, that's still pretty significant in absolute terms.

Some of the issue about the Facebook data is semantic. If you call it your address book stored within Facebook, it seems more like you should be able to get access to that information. After all, it's information your friends have shared with you. But if you think of it as your friends' own profile data, the ownership claim doesn't look as strong, regardless of the matter of whether they agreed to share.

Fundamentally, though, there's nothing stopping people from copying each e-mail address manually from Facebook. The problem crops up when such extraction is automated.

Which is why the Yahoo position is so peculiar. Anyone with a Yahoo Mail account can easily extract not only the names but the e-mail addresses of their Facebook friends. If you want to try this method, first open a fresh e-mail account at Yahoo. As soon as it's created, you'll get an option to import contacts from elsewhere, including Facebook. Choose that option, authorize the tool, and it'll import the contacts.

To make them useful in Google+, you'll then have to transfer them to Google by exporting a CSV (comma-separated values) spreadsheet. Gmail lets you import a CSV file by clicking Contacts, then the More actions button, then the Import menu item. Of course you can use the CSV file elsewhere, too.

Laguna asked how it's possible for Yahoo to extract the data but not others.

""Is there a way to get sanctioned or even paid access?"" Laguna asked, then raised the matter of the two objections Facebook raised about Open-Xchange. ""You must have some kind of arrangement with Yahoo, which even has an import capability of not only the names but also the Facebook e-mail addresses? How can Yahoo do it without violating points 1 and 2 above?""

Facebook wouldn't comment on the Yahoo export tool.

Available exclusively today from CNET Download.com, Panda Cloud Antivirus Free 2.0 (download) and Panda Cloud Antivirus Pro 2.0 (download) bring some welcome changes to Panda's security alternative. The Pro version now comes with a firewall that leverages Panda's community network and uses intrusion prevention signatures.

In version 2.0, people with Cloud Antivirus Free get access to the behavioral analysis engine that had previously been only in the Pro version. Other improvements in both versions include a better exposure of how Cloud Antivirus protects you when you're offline, a cloud-based disinfection protocol, and dramatic improvements in scan benchmarking. Panda representative Pedro Bustamante said that the scans in 2.0 are about ""50 percent"" faster than in version 1.6.

Along with the cloud-enhanced firewall, Cloud Antivirus Pro comes with tech support. The whole package will set you back $29.95, cheaper than many entry-level paid security suites by about $10.

While the changes are interesting, they're probably not going to result in a dramatic bump for Panda's market share. According to analysis firm Opswat, Panda accounted for 2.5 percent of the North American vendor market and 2.9 percent of the global vendor market in June 2012.

Had the company decided to make the firewall available in the free version, then it would be easier to see people taking a chance on Panda. It's a good product, but it still feels a bit anemic when compared to more established free suites like AVG and Avast, and Panda's cloud-based thin client doesn't have the name recognition of Microsoft's comparable Security Essentials.",html

Available at http://market.android.com, the new marketplace features a robust search tool and allows users to install apps directly from the Web.

Having an Android device isn't required to access the new marketplace, although you obviously won't be able to install apps without one. To get started, visit the market and log in using your Google account, the same as the one you use for your phone or tablet. You can browse app categories on the left, or filter by tabs showcasing featured apps, top paid apps, and top free apps.

When the Market debuted earlier in the day, most people saw ""invalid request"" messages when attempting to log in. A tweet from the Android development account indicated that Google had begun working on the problem, and by 12:15 p.m. PT most were able to log in successfully. It's not clear at this time whether the delay was caused by an overload of people attempting to access it at the same time, delays in syncing users' apps, or other unknown problems.

One of the keys with the Market is to log in using the same account that's been associated with your mobile device, since your apps are now synced directly to that Gmail account.

Once logged in, there's very little that's different to visually indicate that you've successfully logged in. You can tell, though, because the upper right corner of the Web page will show your e-mail address and a link to ""My Market Account"". Click it and you're taken to a My Orders tab that lists all your installed apps. These are organized by date last updated, the name of the app, category, price, and status. Currently, these headings can only be sorted by date, although it looks like the kind of layout that will receive an update with more sort parameters in the future.

A second tab labeled Settings currently shows only a list of the devices associated with your account. It shows Nickname, Visibility, Make, Model, Carrier, Last used, and Registered on date. Clicking the Edit button on the right lets you give the device a nickname, and choose whether to hide the device from Android menus. Users who have rooted their devices and are running custom ROMs will not see data for Make and Model.

It appears that multiple, simultaneous account log-ins, a feature recently pushed to Gmail, are not supported.

At the top of the new Market lives a persistent and slick search option. Enter a query and a black bar appears between the bottom of the search box and your results. Click it to reveal search filters to narrow your results. You can install an app directly from the results, or click through to learn more about each app. When you do hit the install link, the Market will let you choose which device to install the app to, as well as show you a list of permissions that the app uses, and its cost. You can also push an app to multiple devices as long as they're associated under the same account.

At least on Verizon's 3G network, an app I installed from the Web site began downloading within 60 seconds of hitting the install button. This was also reflected in the My Orders list. However, it took me jumping into the Market app itself before the new app would appear on my phone. It's not clear whether this is part of the app store's regular behavior, a factor of heavy Market traffic, or another cause entirely.

Previously, the app-to-account sync and push had only been available through third-party markets. The new Android Market does lack features that third-party markets like AppBrain offer, such as customized app lists and uninstallation.

Update, 11:25 a.m. PT: Added Twitter comment from AndroidDev. Update, 1:00 p.m. PT: Noted that the Android Market now appears to be accessible to most users, if not all, and added details on how to use the new Market.

Why camp outside a store for limited-quantity ""door buster"" deals when you can get goods online, snug on your couch with a cup of cocoa? However, you don't want to avoid the mall circus only to get your personal or financial info trampled by an insecure site. Here's how to shop more safely online.

Alternative payment methods

One of the best ways to protect your payment info is to simply not give it to an online store. If the store's website gets hacked, payment info stored in your account may get stolen. Multiply that risk by however many sites you've given your credit card details. Instead, use PayPal as a middleman. There's no additional fee (though PayPal usually charges the store) or additional processing time. You can also enable two-factor authentication on PayPal.

If you're using plastic, a credit card offers more protection than a debit card. With debit cards, payment is directly deducted from your checking account, and if there's a problem with the transaction or the goods, it can be more difficult to recover your money. Credit card charges, on the other hand, can simply be reversed before you pay your credit card bill.

Gift cards are another good option. An online store will treat a gift card with the Visa or MasterCard logo like a credit card. However, there are a few limitations: You may have to pay an activation fee of $5 to $10; the card can only be used with a payment processor physically located in the United States; and it can be tedious to track how much money remains on the card.

Alternatively, you can get a store-specific gift card, like one for Amazon or Best Buy. These have no activation fee. However, they may have expiration dates, so you could lose the stored value if you wait too long. Sometimes the date is on the card itself; other times it's buried in the fine print.

As long as the gift card is not expired, a purchase made with it should never be declined. Even if you have plenty of credit or money in the bank, credit and debit cards can be declined or frozen if you have simply made too many purchases within too short a time, which can easily happen during the week of Cyber Monday.

A double layer of account security

Two-factor authentication (2FA) does a second check to help prevent the use of stolen credit cards and account information. For example, an Amazon transaction requires your password (the first factor). If you enable 2FA on Amazon, it will send a single-use code (the second factor) to your mobile phone via text message, which you enter after you've signed in to the website. Your phone is the only device to receive the code, so even if someone has stolen your username and password, they would still need physical access to your phone to complete a transaction. Two-factor authentication doesn't make unauthorized use totally impossible, but it creates a higher barrier to entry for hackers or people who've nicked your account info.

Setting up Amazon's two-factor authentication

Our example is real, by the way: this week, without fanfare, Amazon added two-factor authentication. To set it up, log in, go to your account page, click Change Account Settings, go to Advanced Security Settings at the bottom, click the Edit button on the right, then select a mobile phone number where Amazon can send SMS messages. When you enter the code Amazon texts you, you'll have two backup options: an alternative phone number or an authenticator app. Selecting the app option displays a QR code that can work with Google Authenticator, Authy, or another such app.

With Google Authenticator, you open the app, tap the settings icon (three stacked dots in the upper right-hand corner), select Set Up Account, choose Scan a Barcode, and hold your phone's camera up to the QR code provided on Amazon's 2FA setup page. This will give you a six-digit code that you enter on the website to link the app to your device. When you do that, Amazon will ask you to confirm that you want to enable 2FA, and it will give you the option to skip 2FA on the device that you've just used to set this system up. The option is enabled by default.

With the authentication app backup, you can enter codes even when your mobile device doesn't have cell reception. So it's good to have this as a plan B for when Wi-Fi or Ethernet are your only options. If you expect to be in a situation where you won't have the app or a network connection, you can tell Amazon to call a landline number and have an automated voice read a code to you. This option is also handy if your device is not set up to receive SMS messages, or if it has a limit on the number of messages you can receive every month.

Whichever method you choose, Amazon's 2FA is free and does not require a Prime membership.

Mobile device security

Phones get lost and stolen, and if you don't have a security filter or two, your efforts setting up online shopping protections could all be for naught. Your first line of defense is usually a PIN code. iOS defaults to four digits, but with iOS 9 Apple has started asking for six digits, which is preferable because it's harder to guess. You can also use a pattern unlock, but those are easier to guess. Facial recognition is more reliable than pattern unlocks, but many phones don't have that option, and the tech may need bright light to work, which isn't always available.

If your device has a fingerprint reader like Apple's Touch ID, that's arguably the best method for most people. Fingerprint info can be faked, but the level of hassle and ingenuity required puts that tactic out of reach of most unauthorized users. Fingerprints contain a lot more unique information than a PIN code or a pattern, yet they can be used much more quickly, combining security and convenience.

Dealing with a lost 2FA Android device

If you do lose your device, there are ways you can lock it out of your personal accounts. Android users have the Android Device Manager (ADM), which you need to set up beforehand. The process is more involved than we'd like on the Android side. iOS users have it easier (explained in the next section). Regardless of platform, it's important to enable device management to protect your personal info, and you only need to set it up once per device.

Android users start by going to the ADM website and logging in to their Google account. Click the Add a Device button, which will display a QR code. Scan this using a QR code app installed on your 2FA device, and it will provide a link to the Google Play store for the Google Apps Device Policy (GADP) app. This may already be installed, in which case you will see an Enable button on the app store page instead of Download or Install. When you tap Enable, an Update button may appear to the left. If so, tap Update first, wait for the update to complete, then tap Open.

GADP will give a brief explanation of what it does. When you're finished reading, tap Next at the bottom of the screen, and GADP will prepare to get registered with your device. Before you can do that, GADP will explain the functions of your device that it wants access to. These are the functions that Android Device Manager can use to protect the personal info on your Android device if the device gets lost or stolen.

When you tap Activate, GADP will tell you that it is about to enforce a higher degree of security for this device. It's important to go over each item. For example, if your Android device is protected with a PIN or a password, GADP will automatically wipe the device if the PIN or password is entered incorrectly 10 times in a row. (iOS users can also enable a 10-try wipe function in the Settings menu.) If you use a password to lock your device, GADP will enhance the password rules, refusing to let you use only letters or only numbers. GADP will also enable you to locate your device on a map, force your phone to ring loudly (even if it's set to silent or vibration mode, which is handy when you can't find it but know that it's nearby), reset the password or PIN, or lock it.

Of course, your lost or stolen device needs to be connected to a cellular or Wi-Fi network if you want to locate it, force ringing, reset PINs and passwords, or lock the screen. Because those commands are being sent by you from another device via the Android Device Manager website (or via the ADM app installed on another Android device). So if the unauthorized user has the device set to airplane mode, you're out of luck. You may also need Location Services enabled.

If you have GADP set up correctly at this point, the ADM website should show your device when you refresh the page, and show the options to reset your PIN or password, make it ring, or lock the screen. If you use this method to lock the screen, even a device with a fingerprint reader cannot use that reader to undo the remote lock. You'll need to use the backup unlock method that you created when you originally set up the reader. So you can use this method if you believe that someone has lifted your print and can use that to unlock your device.

Dealing with a lost iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch

During setup, you associate your Apple device with an Apple ID. You can use this account name and password to log in to iCloud, where you'll find a big button labeled Find iPhone. If your device is connected to a cellular or Wi-FI network, Find iPhone should be able to locate it in about 10 seconds, then place a pin on a map showing where it is, with some margin of error. If you click the pin and then the ""i"" button, you will get three options in the upper right-hand corner of the screen: Play Sound, Lost Mode, and Erase iPhone (or iPad or iPod, depending).

The Play Sound and Erase options are pretty self-explanatory, but Lost Mode may be a mystery to you. It's actually pretty sophisticated. When you enable Lost Mode, a series of options kicks into gear. First, you can create a special message to appear on the device's screen, such as a notification that the item is lost, and your phone number, so someone can call you to let you retrieve it. Second, the device will go into a special silent mode where it won't ring or display notifications. And third, it will try to suspend any payment options that you've set up in Apple Pay.

As with Android devices, it's possible to prevent Find iPhone from communicating with and locating the device if someone blocks its network connectivity, so the system isn't foolproof. And the finder function can be individually disabled in the device's settings. But you at least have some ways to protect your credit cards and other things you'll use to buy stuff online. You can also force your device to use two-factor authentication when it attempts to connect to your Apple ID (like when you make a purchase in iTunes). However, there's a 72-hour waiting period to set up 2FA on Apple devices, so don't wait until the last minute to get set up properly for Cyber Monday.

Strong passwords and password managers

We created guides to passwords and password managers a few months ago, and not much has changed since. The upshot: Use a password manager to automatically generate and store passwords that are very difficult to guess. If you use a cloud-based manager like LastPass (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android) or Dashlane (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android), you can streamline the sharing of that library across devices. If your device has a fingerprint reader, LastPass can use that to unlock your library, instead of requiring a master password each time.

With strong account passwords, payment protections, two-factor authentication, reliable locks on your devices, and a gameplan for handling a lost or stolen phone, you should be well-positioned for safe spending on Cyber Monday.

I like to go naked. And I'm not talking clothes--but with gadgets.

I've never been a big fan of cases for anything, be it my cell phone or a computer. As a result, things can get dinged up or completely destroyed when dropped, but so far I've been pretty lucky. That's why I'm perplexed by my enjoyment of something called the TyPad. It's a gadget case, but one with a few tricks up its sleeve, that's making me seriously consider covering up--my iPad at least.

The $129 TyPad is a leather case for the iPad that's got a built-in Bluetooth keyboard. When your iPad has been inserted into its open top flap, the setup resembles a clamshell computer. In fact, during the last week of my testing it, people were frequently coming up to ask what kind of computer I was using--not realizing what they saw was just a case. Their next questions were usually where can it be purchased and how much does it cost.

The keyboard that's built into the case feels about the same as those silicone, roll-up USB keyboards that can be had for around $15 to $20. In this case, though, it's got a built-in lithium ion battery that keeps it juiced up without leeching any power from your iPad's battery, or taking up the device's 30-pin connector. You are, however, required to carry around a USB-to-Micro-USB adapter if you wish to charge the keyboard on the go, since that's the only plug on the device.

The keyboard packs a rated standby time of 100 days and 90 hours of typing. When the battery gets down to about an hour, it will begin blinking to let you know. There's also an on/off switch you can toggle to prevent draining the battery when you're not using the keyboard.

Typing on the TyPad's keyboard is a satisfactory experience, though it's a far cry from using a proper laptop or even Apple's iPad keyboard accessory, which is built like a standard desktop keyboard. Once you get used to the feel of the keys and their placement, though, it's easy to fly through e-mail replies or a proper, multiparagraph document.

Where you can get tripped up, though, is that some of the shortcuts found on the iPad's digital keyboard don't come along for the analog ride. For instance, hitting the space bar twice will give you two spaces, unlike when you do it on the iPad and a period gets added. The TyPad also won't autocapitalize letters right after a period, which the iPad does when you're typing onscreen. This takes a little getting used to.

While I found the keyboard buttons and placement to be fine, several of the people I showed it to--friends and colleagues--all found a deal killer: there's no right shift key. This was never a problem for me since I stick to the left one almost exclusively, but for them, it was the cause of great frustration.

Robert Lotz, the TyPad's designer, explained to me in a phone interview last week that the lack of that right shift key can be blamed on the diminutive size. ""For our next generation we're already working on that. And for future versions of this product that will support other tablets that are out there."" Some of those will include RIM's PlayBook, Samsung's Galaxy Tab, and Best Buy's upcoming Rocketfish tablet, Lotz said.

Josh Lowensohn/CNET

Another deal killer might be that you cannot lock your device into any one particular position. The screen rests on the keyboard section rather insecurely on a rounded wedge. When put up in clamshell mode, the screen sits up just fine, but if you want to adjust it beyond that, you're limited to a very small number of alternate angles on a textured section of the keyboard itself.

This limitation can be especially frustrating when trying to use the TyPad on your lap, as I found while writing a big chunk of this story from a seat waiting at the airport. The whole unit tends to bob around with each keystroke, and this resulted in my iPad either tipping back, or flopping down onto the keyboard a number of times. You also are unable to push it back far enough to be looking at the screen from a 45-degree angle, a position good for movie watching.

Josh Lowensohn/CNET

Where the TyPad manages to work out quite well, though, is on airplanes--but only as a stand. On a short-hop flight I took last weekend, the TyPad performed beautifully while on the seat-back tray. Even with a few unexpected bumps, the screen stayed where it was supposed to, and did not flop over when the guy in front of me pushed back to take a nap. Worth noting though, is that you can't use the keyboard, since it transmits a signal--a big no-no for portable electronic devices on planes.

So, faults aside, the overall experience of using the TyPad is positive. While the iPad can be used in full without a keyboard, if you ever plan to take it out as a work machine, this is a package that will protect it, and give your typing a boost--that is, as long as you have a flat, stable surface nearby.

Is it worth the $129 sticker price? That's the hard question to answer. If you do the math of finding a leather folio case, and buying Apple's Bluetooth keyboard, you'll no doubt save a little money and get something that's lighter to carry when you don't care about having a keyboard. It's the fact that you're getting both in one package that makes the TyPad appealing.

Updated at 9 p.m. PDT to add note about not using the Bluetooth features of the TyPad on airplanes.",html

The marketplace, similar to Google's Android Market and Apple's iPhone App Store, is designed for Chrome 8, which was released last week. It offers apps, as well as extensions and themes, for customizing the browser.

Amazon said it is offering its Windowshop app, a stripped-down version of Amazon.com, on the marketplace. There also is an NPR news app, Facebook Photo Zoom, a New York Times app, and lots of games. The check-out process is integrated with Google Checkout.

The Chrome Web Store, which was expected to launch in October, was demonstrated at a Google event in San Francisco earlier today. The marketplace is only available in the U.S., but will expand to other countries early next year.

""The Chrome Web Store itself can be accessed using any browser. Currently only users of Google Chrome are able to install an app from the Chrome Web Store, which adds a shortcut on the Chrome browser's new tab page,"" a Google spokesperson said in a statement.

LAS VEGAS--Microsoft today announced that it will give out $250,000 in BlueHat Prize rewards for innovative research on computer security defense.

Winners will be announced at next year's Black Hat security conference, with the grand prize being $200,000 and second prize being $50,000, Katie Moussouris, head of Microsoft's Security Community Outreach and Strategy team, said in a conference call from the conference being held here.

Researchers will own the intellectual property from their inventions and Microsoft will be able to use the technology under a royalty-free license, she said.

""This is a new program to inspire security researchers to focus on security defense technologies,"" she said. The initiative features more than $250,000 in cash and prizes ""for original ideas to protect customers.""

""The inaugural Microsoft BlueHat Prize contest challenges security researchers to design a novel runtime mitigation technology designed to prevent the exploitation of memory safety vulnerabilities,"" like buffer overflows and dangling pointers that deal with random-access memory (RAM), the Microsoft BlueHat Prize Web site says.

Microsoft employees are ineligible and participants have to be 14 years or older. Contestants have until April 1, 2012, to submit their work.

Unlike Mozilla, Google and now Facebook, which offer bug bounty programs, and TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative, which offers top dollar for bugs discovered in Microsoft software, Microsoft does not pay vulnerability researchers when they report bugs. Moussouris said the company is sticking with that policy.

""There are a lot more motivations for vulnerability research on our products than just money,"" she said, including public recognition and the ""pursuit of intellectual happiness.""

""Even though there is an existing legitimate market for individual vulnerabilities...the researchers who find vulnerabilities in Microsoft products tend to come straight to us and forgo some of those individual reward programs,"" Moussouris said. ""We respect the researchers' rights to make a living off their research.""",html

In fact, I'm pretty sure the e-mail didn't even have a subject. Once I clicked the link and started watching the video I realized why: how does one neatly describe the hilarity of a video in which a monkey forcibly rides a pig backward? Even better, the video's creator, Perry Gripp, wrote a silly song to go with the video. If you haven't seen it, the video is worth checking out for a good laugh, but be warned: the song will stick with you well after you watch it.

(Credit: Screenshot by Jason Parker/CNET)

Today I received a press release that game studio Kihon has designed a game around the silly concept in the video. Not only that, but it got Perry Gripp's permission to use the song in the game.

The result is Baby Monkey (going backwards on a pig) (99 cents) for the iPhone. The game has exactly two controls: a button on the left to make the monkey jump and a button on the right to make the pig jump. In this survival/distance game, you try to hang on to the pig as long as possible while jumping up to grab bananas and avoid objects that will knock you off. You'll also need to jump with the pig to reach higher and to avoid cliffs and other obstacles. As the game progresses, the pig runs faster and you'll get bonuses for putting together banana-grabbing combos.

Baby Monkey (going backwards on a pig) offers dynamically created areas so no two games are alike. In the game's description, Kihon says you'll run across sand castles, toxic waste pits, and even a T-Rex, but I haven't been able to stay on long enough to see all that yet. The game also supports GameCenter so you can track high scores and see how well you do against other players.

Overall, Baby Monkey (going backwards on a pig) is a great time-waster that can be enjoyed by the whole family. If you chuckled at the viral video or just like well-made distance/survival games, you should check out this app.",html

Czech Republic-based Avast issued an update late on Wednesday to its antivirus software that mistakenly flagged hundreds of innocent files as a Trojan. It fixed the situation five and a half hours later.

Falsely labeled as malware were programs from Adobe, Realtek, sound card drivers, and various media players, among others, according to a blog post on the Avast Support Center.

The software was identifying the good files as the Win32:Delf-MZG Trojan, according to Avast.

Avast, based in Prague, did not respond to an e-mail late on Wednesday seeking comment.

http://ces.cnet.com/8301-32254_1-20027535-283.html,CES: RealNetworks attempts to Unifi the cloud,,2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"RealNetworks

LAS VEGAS--These days, cloud services are all the rage for early adopters and business-minded individuals, but they haven't managed to make their way into the mainstream quite yet. However, companies like RealNetworks are banking on the fact that someday all consumers will want to store their content--media, in particular--up in the cloud.

Today, RealNetworks announced Unifi, a multimedia-centric cloud service that aggregates your photos, music, and video files from across multiple devices and online services. In other words, instead of having to keep track of multiple media libraries, you get a single online interface for organizing and accessing your content. Better yet, there are no restrictions on the type of content or its location, so the service will pull from absolutely any library and any device. Plus, all devices can act as ""remotes"" for the library, and you can upload images as well.

While it's not for everyone, the undeniable fact is that having your files stored in a readily accessible spot--from any location--is incredibly convenient. With Unifi, RealNetworks takes that convenience to the next level by providing a user-friendly interface that collects user content from across platforms and services. If they pull it off smoothly, we're pretty intrigued by the prospect.

Update: Unifi will be available as a public beta within the next couple of months for those who want to try it out, and RealNetworks intends to launch companion apps for the iOS and the Android platforms around the same time. Apps for BlackBerry and Windows 7 are expected to launch later in the year.

As for storage and pricing, Unifi is set to operate on the freemium model utilized by most other cloud services. The first 2GB are free, and there will also be subscription plans available up to at least 100GB.

I got a chance to sit in on a demo of Unifi, and the service and user interface are looking great so far. I especially liked the option to automatically back up photos taken on your device to the cloud. However, it seemed like the video functionality isn't fully baked yet, though RealNetworks does have plans to offer a premium video service down the line.",html
http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-10213183-12.html,BumpTop: Software toy or useful desktop replacement?,"April,Pm,Rafe Needleman",2018-01-11T17:23:00+00:00,"Nearly three years ago, a video demo of a new desktop user interface, the BumpTop, captivated YouTube viewers. A year later the creator, Anand Agarawala, was called to the august TED conference to present. Now the BumpTop software is here, ready for you and your Windows PC. I gave it a spin.

It's certainly very cool. In many ways it is a better desktop than the one that comes with Windows (even Windows 7) or OS X. But as cool as it is, it feels like a toy. That's because the locus of modern personal computing is not the desktop. People live in apps and in the browser.

BumpTop makes the desktop better, but so what? It won't make you more productive in your e-mail app, and it currently doesn't touch the Web browsing experience. BumpTop doesn't go deep enough into Windows to replace the way we work with information. Instead, it adds yet another interface to use in addition to the Windows utilities (like the file manager), your apps, and your Web browser.

(Credit: Screenshot by Rafe Needleman/CNET)

With that curmudgeonly view on the table, let's look at the cool stuff that BumpTop does. Because even though it's a toy right now, you're going to want to try it.

BumpTop makes the items on your computer's desktop more manageble and more like their real-world counterparts. You can fling folders (and icons) around, and they have weight, which is related to size, which indicates importance to you. Items grow when you use them more, or you can grow or shrink them manually. You can stack items into groups, view them as if they were pages in a book, spread them out along arbitrary paths, or show them in nice square grids (boring).

To work with items, you lasso them together. And instead of the typical, squared-off interface of a PC, where selection boxes are all rectangles, everything stays upright, and all icons are the same size, BumpTop lets you select items by drawing vague circles around them, and the icons can fly all over the place, change sizes, and flip around. Things can be scattered around in a way that more closely resembles the real world. It may not be square and clean, but thanks to subtle visual cues, like angle, size, and proximity, you'll probably find a BumpTop desktop easier to scan.

For photos that you have on your desktop, you get a nice viewer, complete with a vertiginous zoom in to pictures on your desktop when you click on them. Everything else opens up in its native Windows app.

BumpTop uses ""pie menus,"" circular wheels where the options are arrayed like pie slices. It's an easier system for your muscles to remember--you just flick your mouse or pen or finger in the direction of the option you want.

You also get ""walls"" on your desktop on which to pin things, a UI concept that works very well for reminder notes, photos, and destination apps. For example, you can fling a picture to the Facebook app that's pinned on a wall and it will post it to your account. There's also an e-mail icon, and a Twitter/Twitpic icon you can fling to.

BumpTop uses the 3D accelerator in your PC. And in addition to giving your icons an imitation of physicality, it's gorgeous. However, while a 3D-accelerated desktop was new for Windows in 2006, today some of the Aero effects in Vista (and even moreso the effects in Windows 7) also use the graphics power of your PC to create spectacular visuals.

The interface works fine with a mouse, but is clearly better suited to a touch interface. Lassoing and gesturing, and particularly the pie menus, seem created for touch controls. A multi-touch version will come when Windows 7 ships. BumpTop would be killer on a Surface computer.

The business

BumpTop makes for a great gee-whiz demo, and a cool desktop for a PC.

I'd like to see the technology under the covers of BumpTop migrate to desktop OS interfaces and apps, and it'd be really interesting if developers started to make bumpable apps and widgets for the platform. Will that ever happen? That's the challenge for Agarawala. He is talking to hardware manufacturers (he wouldn't say who, but I think the touchscreen laptop he used in the video demo gives a hint). He says, ""BumpTop gives OEMs an ability to differentiate."" And that's true, but you don't get broad developer adoption by releasing a product that runs on only one vendor's line, or that's on several but customized and different on each. For BumpTop to take off with developers, it needs broad distribution. It belongs in the operating system. Apple has filed a patent on concepts very similar to BumpTop.

The basic product will be available as a free download, fortunately. There's also a pro version for $29 that has some extra features, such as the pile flipping function and support for unlimited sticky notes. The first 200 people that click here get the pro version free. Update: the free passes are all gone, sorry. Try the Download.com link at the end of this story.

A future version may have some form of a Web browser built into it. Webkit (the same technology used by Chrome and Safari) is embedded in BumpTop, just not exposed to the user yet. When a BumpTop malleable interface starts to work directly with Web pages, I will be much more interested in it.

Meantime, BumpTop is worth a try. It's a lot of fun.

On Wednesday, BumpTop is exclusively available for download courtesy of Download.com. Download BumpTop 1.0.",html
